https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"If you like pumpernickel type bread you will enjoy this, rich in fibre and protein and very low carb content, it is very filling. I like it with everything, but it would be perfect slightly toasted with salmon and cream cheese,  eggs or avocado toast.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"As I'm trying to cut down on carbs, particularly quick snacks, I came across this bread in low carb section and it's been a staple in my weekly shopping basket since. It's similar to pumpernickel bread and definitely tastes better toasted. I only wish it came in a bigger packet! ",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"Really horrid! Dry and unpalatable, even toasted, with a weird smell. It ended in the bin.  Fortunately it was a tiny packet. I shall never buy this again and will definitely not recommend it. I'd rather make my own.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,Diabetic on a low carb high protein diet and still working out what spikes my blood and what doesnt so thought I would try. Agree with the other reviews 5 very small slices so very very expensive for what you get so really should have a star deducted but the taste is immense. Very like rye and lighter than pumpernickel but closest thing to proper bread you are going to get. Was weird to toast as it took a little longer and went in brown and didnt really change colour but still tasted so good!,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"Well, this was an expensive purchase!  Only 6 thin slices which is even less than other similar types of rye bread.  Tasted good toasted and quite filling too with scrambled egg on top.  Just a bit of a shock opening the bag to find so little there!",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"Carbzone bread is *amazing*.

It isn't like your usual bread - it's more like a rye bread. It's very Scandinavian (makes sense, the company is Swedish) and tastes almost exactly like the rye bread I ate in Finland as a child. It isn't very nice as is, but 3 or 4 minutes in the toaster and it's incredible.

It is the perfect accompaniment for cream cheese, smoked salmon and fresh dill. It's heavenly. Worth every single penny.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,I personally enjoy this bread but it tastes nothing like regular bread so be warned. Its more like a nutty rye bread which is fine with me. Tastes great when toasted and is firm and keeps its crunchiness. It is pricey but for those moaning at ocado the actual carbzone website sells it for the same price so we cant expect ocado to sell it for less but I agree it is very pricey for what it is considering I can buy a whole loaf of loaf carb bread with 12 slices for the same price,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,Great toasted with peanut butter,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"Was better than expected! Nice taste. Lots of soft linseeds that are fun to pop between your teeth. More dense thicker than normal bread. Very thin slices which are the perfect size. These just about worked for french toast/eggy bread, tho not quite the same as normal!",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"Tastes quite a bit like real German rye bread. Good macros for keto. You can easily fit a slice or two a day. Don’t try to toast, unless you want a cracker. Expensive, but worth it as it is very filling.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,This is a delicious low carb find. I mean you wouldn’t have it as a traditional sandwich as I’d think it’s too dense but toasted with melted cheese and mushrooms or mashed avocado is absolutely delicious! If you’re trying to reduce your carbs definitely worth a try…,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"I ummed and ahhed about whether to give this product 5 stars or not.  I only hesitated as it is not the most delicious bread you will ever taste.  You are not at risk of having slice after slice with lashings of butter and then wonder where the loaf has gone!  And you most certainly won’t want to offer it to guests at a dinner party (or even for breakfast as bacon sandwich).  But if you are looking for low carb alternatives this is the best I have found!  Most low carb bread based products seem to achieve their low carb status by removing solid matter and replacing it with air.  Some of the low carb wraps available are like eating cotton wool and an iceberg lettuce leaf is a far better alternative.  However this bread is packed with flavour.  You actually feel like you are eating something and it does fill you up!  It is akin to a rich rye bread and packed with seeds.  It is made in Germany, and the Germans do good bread!  If you are trying to be good and reduce your carb intake this bread allows you feel not quite so deprived.  You can have your little something on toast guilt free!  It is quite expensive for 5 slices of bread, but as it is so filling you won’t eat as much.  Plus, if you are trying to reduce your carbs it is not an everyday eat, more of a treat.  If you are not worried about your carb intake then don’t bother, you won’t be impressed.  As it says on the pack, it is “for the carb conscious”.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"Yes this is expensive for 5 slices and no it doesn't taste like 'normal' bread but it's delicious and worth it.  It tastes like a traditional rye bread, dense and with lots of seeds. Really good. It's low carb, low calorie, really good for you and tastes great. I eat very limited carbs and sugar and really enjoy eating this bread - it's a treat ",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,I bought this bread because I am trying to increase my protein intake.  I should have looked closer at the list of ingredients as this tasted nothing like bread.  It has a strange dense chewy texture and takes ages to toast.  I had it with butter and marmite but did not really enjoy it and was glad that there were only 5 slices as at over 50p a slice I did not want to waste it.  Would not buy again although impressed by the high protein content.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"If you're diabetic and want to avoid carbs then this is a reasonable bread replacement.
YES - it is expensive and if you are looking for ""value for money"" this is not for you.
What is this for ?  It's for people that want to add variety to their diet and can afford to do so.
Yes - it should be cheaper - but it is not. If I had the time and patience I would set up a company that sells it cheaper and make a million pounds but I am no good at business so I hopefully someone else can do it - OR - perhaps it's not as easy as that after all :-)).
It is what it is - it's quite tasty - and if you think it's too expensive - please please don't buy it !!!",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"I bought this product based on the fact that their wraps are indistinguishable from the real thing. This ""bread"", though, is horrific. It's really salty, dries your mouth and is hard to swallow. and ridiculously expensive",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,Tasty and keeps for ages. Been having it with smoked salmon tomatoes spinach and ricotta for a healthy protein rich meal and its great! Havent actually tried it toasted will do so next. Need more products like this that are low carb and high protein!,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,This is a lovely low carb bread. I toasted it and added goats butter and marmite. Looking forward to having it toasted with poached eggs too. Not sure how well it would work in a sandwich without it being toasted but it is what it is - a low carb vehicle which is also quite tasty with good texture.,NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"I have really enjoyed this bread. The flavour and texture go well with many accompaniments and it has very low carbohydrate content. Unfortunately it is always out of stock and it becomes very difficult to organise meals and shopping to satisfy certain dietary requirements when stock levels are always so unreliable. As with so many other items, referring also to pre covid crisis, it is often a case of rearranging your diet/meals around what is available, rather than being truly organised and buying what you need, plus requiring unwanted shopping trips elsewhere. Please increase stock.",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"Ive been following the keto diet for a number of weeks and this bread is a bit of a game changer for me. No, its not clean keto and yes, the slices are very skinny and dense BUT theres lots of goodness in there in the form of seeds so it doesnt lack flavour. I wont be making a sandwich out of it any time soon but toasted with your favourite avocado mix, spread with pate or cut into soldiers and dunked in a bake Camembert- its a winner. My dropped star was down to the price. It is very pricey for 5 slender slices but I guess that in itself will prevent me from overindulging!",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,"This truly is low carb bread and just what I have been looking for. It resembles a soft pumpernickel with lots of seeds.

So dont buy this thinking youre getting a loaf. Its quite thin - seedy and brown in appearance. It toasts quite nicely.

Perfect for pretending youre from Copenhagen, enjoying an open sandwich.",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,I have only had this toasted and I think its great. Tasty low carb option and freezes well.

https://www.ocado.com/products/carbzone-lowcarb-protein-rich-bread-304465011,By far the best pumpernicel type bread for me. I find the normal brands really dry and prefer the texture of this one. Good flavour and has loads of fibre and protein. Worth the money,NA

Florette needs to make the carrot slivers less fine to prevent this. They also when gone like this stick all over the leaves too, so none of the salad is edible.

The shock was the Ocado lady kept me waiting a very long time then said ""we refuse to refund you as you were advised to take a pic"". I was really upset as I had been very inconvenienced by this salad being inedible 2 weeks in a row and I am housebound so had had to do without salad, which for me is an essential part of my diet, for 2 weeks, as I can't go out and buy some.

However they used to have more flavour and were quite spicy with black pepper. Now they are much blander. They are also not very tender anymore, often grisly and quite frequently now we've had chunks of skin. Quite a bit gets thrown away now as inedible, that never used to happen.

It does need to be shaken before each time you use it as the almond settles at the bottom of the carton. If you dont shake before each use, once you finish the carton youll find that there is a big lump of hard almond sediment at the bottom of the carton.

I’m guessing possibly even though they have gluten in the factory, they test at below 20ppm still so can legally be labelled gluten free maybe?

Alternatively, from their shape & and mention of chickpeas in the ingredients, you might expect a falafel-kind-of-thing, but for falafel, it's actually too mushy and a bit bland, whilst also being more expensive than other falafel brands.

With other Pip Organic juices, he usually nearly finishes it all. With this one, he only drank just about half of it.

At first i thought it was a good choice because obviously it was nice to start of with, but a few days in i started to notice things going horribly wrong with this product. First of all the packaging wasn't up to standard the carton itself gets easily dented not like most milk carton products and the lid would not screw on properly so it caused leakage when put on its side, Second of all i think the company who produces this milk needs to do further testing on when it is going to go out of date and my reason for that is i used this milk for about 4 days tops and then i fancied a wee cup of coffee and what did i get? A faking sh1t heap and what i mean by that is the milk went off and lumpy and i could not sit down to enjoy my cup of coffee. I think for the most part from what i've learned in my experience using Craven dale is to just USE YOUR LOCAL DAIRY SUPPLIER.

I often butter sautee King Oyster mushroom, with a little drop of soy sauce and squeezed lemon to finish. Enoki and Shimeji can keep their shape well and so suitable for any cooking, and they are great for Japanese style soup / miso soup.

One of the previous reviewers mentioned of white mould, but that is neither mould or a thing to worry about.

It has ‘natural flavourings’ oh well, that’s fine then, no need for silly old rhubarb!

Moved to tea for my morning cuppa.Now even using the best tea am losing interest and de sensitised from the deliscious taste of it.
To Reduce my coffee addiction I tried every instant coffee to the highest prices.
There were a few quite nice ones though made me realise how excellent standard Nescafe instant coffee is.
Someone recommended this so I bought a small one going cheap.
Wow,I was hugely impressed.This tasted strong but not bitter,real depth of flavour,broad deep and potent.
Aware of the 5% fresh ground it contains which helps.Have had many 5% fresh ground instant coffees before and does give it it an extra kick and fresh taste but did not compare to this one.
A slight unpleasant after taste with a slightly rough digestive after effect but this is common for me.
The last point is that it tastes like fresh ground coffee and is really excellent,full flavoured,deep,strong and deliscious.
If you like your coffee mild or like a good bitter edge then this may not be the coffee for you.Having said this it isn't smoothly comfortable.Still has a strong edge to it.

The filling is really very light in meat and it looks like it’s all gravy. After you cook it you find the beef has effectively melted into the gravy. The filling is tasty enough but it’s not enough for 2. It was simply lacking some substance.


The pastry is was not a success and didn’t look appetising but it was edible.

It lists as 1.04kg, mine weighed 951g, the 'stuffing' weighed 100g so what I got was a piece of meat weighing 850g

Reading the ingredients the stuffing it did not seem appealing so it was removed from the joint.

The ham did not compliment the beef at all, in fact most of it was left on o be side.
The beef was okay, tender enough, I have had lots of beef joints better tasting and tender and some tougher and bland.

Since 2021, this company has completely overhauled its packaging to make it sustainable. If you check their website, it’s now entirely compostable and made of sugar cane, cotton and paper. Apart from that, this is one of the only rooibos I enjoy. The balance of vanilla and cocoa flavours is just right, without any of the synthetic sickly sweetness you sometimes get with other brands. It really is delicious and a lovely relaxing tea.",NA

Those make this tea spectacular!  Almost like a dessert.  Crazy good!

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-cheesy-dirty-fries-514450011,These spicy chips with cheese are absolutely delicious. I served them up with chicken tenders and a bit of lettuce on the side to balance it all out. Probably not great if your on a calorie controlled diet.,NA

Some of the fries were not cooked all the way through, even after leaving them for slightly longer than the instructions suggested.

They are supposed to me 'mild' spice wise, and I do like a bit of a kick, but I found them pretty hot would say at least a 'medium'. But not really in a good way - as it wasn't balanced with the cheese etc - which you can barely taste. As some of the others have said, some of the chips were a bit hard inside too.

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-british-12-unsmoked-streaky-bacon-rashers-made-without-nitrites-516390011,"We buy this bacon mainly because it is nitrite free and if you buy 2 packs it is quite reasonable.There are many scientific research studies now showing a strong link between nitrites in food  to increase in cancer so we try and avoid most processed meats  with bacon being the one that we buy. I'm so pleased that now we can buy nitrite free bacon at a reasonable cost.
This bacon tastes delicious,fresh but I have to say a lot of oil comes out when cooking and the bacon reduces to almost half the size that you see in the pack but it is streaky bacon after all so one must expect that it will have a lot of oil! But mostly oozes out as you cook so not going into your body! 
We do recommend this bacon if you are looking for a nitrite-free bacon it tastes delicious.",NA

So, seeing this cordial option made me want to taste an alternative.  The pros - it does taste great diluted in water or even as a supplement to a mild juice.  You do not even assume that this is a Kombucha product because there is no usual sediment or beer-like quality.  So, you assume it is a tame version.  Well, clearly I was wrong.  The cons - I made a mistake of pouring to taste vs. the recommended 1 part product vs.10 parts water.  I used a 500ml bottle of water.  It tasted great.  But, I did not believe the label that it was a highly concentrated form of Kombucha because it does not even taste fermented.  Well, it is. If you use too much, your body will do exactly what Kombucha was meant to do, which is detoxify and flush you out.  I was quite ill the next morning.  Very potent stuff I must say.

I noticed that the dough looked and smelt over-proved, even the skin had turned an unusual shade of grey.  I have made my own sourdough bread for many years, I understand nurturing a sourdough starter.  This was far removed from sourdough and what the kids have grown used to from Pizza Pilgrims.  I trudged along and made a pizza anyway, the rest of the ingredients were otherwise perfect.  The result was flat, very sour and inedible because the dough was just too far gone.

https://www.ocado.com/products/pizza-pilgrims-margherita-pizza-kit-for-2-563903011,"I bought these on a whim in a flash sales. Having had a lot of experience with pizza dough, I thought wed try these for a bit of fun, especially as they used the gob and grill rather than over/pizza oven. The trick is the dough the first one my hubby tried to make (a disaster). He over handles the dough and didnt use enough flour. It was edible but the dough was under cooked. I made the second to much more success. I loved how you had enough of every ingredient that youd need, but it is only enough for 2 people. It would be more cost effective to pitches the frozen pizza dough (already on sale at Ocado), and the remaining ingredients. Nevertheless, it was a fun experiment, but sadly we wont be doing it again unless glad price or more, as its simply not worth the money, despite the delicious taste.",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-fruit-wedge-selection-517732011,"I bought this in a flash sale but still feel ripped off. None of the melon was sweet. It was all underripe or poor quality. The mango wasnt ripe. The apple was soft and not very nice. The only part that was good was the pineapple, hence the two stars instead of one. The shelf life was just one day. M&S used to sell lovely prepared fruit. Has their quality gone down overall or do they just give poorer stock to Ocado? Really poor.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-fruit-wedge-selection-517732011,"Luckily I was only using it next day after the delivery. I don’t think it would have stayed fresh 1 more day as stated on use by date.
Saved me a lot of chopping to cater for my son’s birthday party and kids loved the fruit selection. Hence 3* even though so pricey for what it is.
I would say though- Marks and Spencer cuts on packaging (I understand that it’s all about our environment) and so instead of having separate compartments for each type of fruit it is all very tightly packed together. Apple wedges got very soggy saturated with juice from other fruits. Also some apple wedges were bruised. Not ideal. 
It is party food and for this purpose having a bit more plastic and more compartments to separate fruit would be useful.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-fruit-wedge-selection-517732011,"I tried this because it was exceptional value in the flash sale. 
It arrived Thursday with use by date of Sunday and it was all perfectly fresh and in excellent condition. Two trays sealed separately, so half could be used keeping the other half still sealed. It would be even better if each tray contained the full mixture, but both still had a choice of three. 
Friday we had the three types of melon between us. Saturday the pineapple, mango and apple. 
Some of the melon was slightly hard and less ripe than perfect, but all pretty good. Without it all being tasted and a lot of food waste I don't see how this could be avoided. It was all within the ripeness range of perfectly good to eat. 
I would buy it all the time at the flash sale price of £6, but cannot personally justify it at £12 as if sent with a shorter date we would struggle to eat it all in time. If the date was guaranteed to be as long as the one I received and  I needed this quantity of fruit for a larger gathering  I would happily pay full price, based on the quality and quantity received on this occasion.",NA

Therefore I was concerned and a bit surprised when I queried with Clipper about their use of polypropylene to seal the bags, and they advised that they do indeed use this in almost all their teabags, but like other makes, are apparently researchIng alternatives, as are aware of the concerns about plastic.
The only way to avoid this is to buy loose tea.
If you are bothered about this, I suggest you write to Clipper or your favourite teabag manufacturer to make them aware. Also a website I came across called Moral Fibres gives a good rundown of responses on this issue from a number of well known teabag makers.

This is a really good product for those who are trying to cut down on meat products and need to start by replacing chicken burgers or escalopes.

These soy based escalopes are certainly convenient, cooking very quickly if pan-fried. And they taste of meat, although exactly which meat is rather harder to say.
