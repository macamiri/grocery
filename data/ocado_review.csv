product,reviews
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"I love the smell of the Grapefruit and Orange shampoo, it's nice and uplifting. This formula is good for cleaning oily scalps, but it is drying on the hair shaft."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,My hair smells like a well known dish washing liquid brand... 
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"Love this product. It looks good on my shower shelf, is massive and hence is lasting a long time, and it suits my slightly greasy but dyed hair. Love its environmental credentials too."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,I dont understand all the perfect reviews for this range. The shampoo is just about ok but the scent is overpowering. It didnt do a lot for my hair and the conditioner was useless.
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,left my hair feeling lank and greasy - would not buy again
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"I really like this product, lovely smell and makes my hair soft too. I buy it when discounted."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"I tried this after reading so many great reviews and was not disappointed! Lovely fresh fragrance that my partner noticed straight away, and my hair feels soft and clean. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,Leaves my hair soft and smelling wonderful
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,I have tried so many different natural shampoos and conditioners and these are definitely the best. They leave you hair smelling great and clean.
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"A great shampoo, but the bottle was not sealed so it leaked contents over the shopping during transit, hence the 3 stars"
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,The first ever shampoo that keeps my hair so clean I don't need a pony tail the day after washing it. And it's vegan!! Give it a try when on offer!
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"I use the matching shower gel and thought I'd try this, despite the mixed reviews.  I have to say that it suited my rather flyaway hair so maybe it's just a question of trying it out?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"I was searching for vegan natural shampoo, was happy to find new brand. But shampoo left my hair weird and feeling like dried grass. Do not recommend, sorry."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,This is absolutely the nicest shampoo I have ever used. It smells absolutely divine and leaves my hair so so soft. Love it!
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,I don't tend to stick to one type of shampoo but since trying this I have replaced it several times. Smells lovely and my hair looks great used with the conditioner it is tangle free.
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"Wow, what can I say? Well it's just brilliant. I have developed an itchy scalp & thought maybe it was due to sls.  Used it for the first time, along with the matching conditioner. Hair is clean, soft & actually looks lighter! I do not colour my hair at all so I think this has got rid of any residue fro my other shampoo etc that probably dulled my hair. Would recommend to all"
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"Really yummy shampoo. Scent is gorge and washes hair beautifully. Could do without the propyl ingredients as they are the bad guys, but one day hopefully this will change."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"I'm not fussy when it comes to shampoo, I'd use pretty much any brand. I thought I'd buy something organic and free from nasties but this shampoo isn't working for me. I don't like the smell and for some reason my hair doesn't feel clean. Feels quite greasy. Very unpleasant."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"This is a really very good shampoo. I have fine, straight hair which gets greasy very quickly. I was looking for a vegan, organic, cruelty free shampoo that was effective in hard water. Bingo! I found this one which, please excuse the cliche, ticks all the boxes and more! It also adds volume. I used to have to wash my hair every day (I know, not good for greasy hair but I couldnt go out with my hair looking like that). Now I can go 3 or 4 days without washing it. The flaky scalp is no more. Im sticking with this shampoo and highly recommend it to anyone else."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,It is the best vegan shampoo I have ever used.
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,My hair feels super cleansed after using this. The fragrance is lovely and zingy!
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,This has become my favourite shampoo. It smells gorgeous and leaves my hair shiny and fresh. Add in the fact that its cruelty free and British made and whats not to love.
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,Lovely scented shampoo which is kind to your hair & scalp. Only a minor thing but it could be a little thicker as I found it to be a bit runny. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,My hair feels silky and beautiful
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,All from natural sources and organic - smells delicious and only need a small dollop to work into lather. Worth the extra cost. Love it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"Been using this for years. It is consistently good in hard water areas, good value for money, no nasties and British made. All good :)"
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"Fantastic fragrance, nice texture and long lasting results. Will buy again"
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,"This shampoo is great.It leaves hair nice and glossy and it smells lovely.
The ingredients are all natural too.
It has a thin consistency but you don't need a lot to make a good lather."
https://www.ocado.com/products/faith-in-nature-grapefruit-orange-shampoo-289234011,This has a gorgeous scent which is not too strong. Pricey but you only need a little. It just takes ever so slightly longer to begin to lather than shampoos containing sodium laureth sulphate.
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"I have developed really bad psoriasis on my scalp which meant after a day I would have to wash my hair otherwise my scalp would be raw, scabby and itchy. 
I've used this for a week and it has really helped.
It leaves my hair squeaky clean. Like hairdresser clean. I just add a little conditioner to my ends rather than scalp now.
It is mildly cooling from the mint and ginger I expect, nowhere as strong as Head and Shoulders. 
I can go longer between washes before my head starts itching. My psoriasis is clearing up and definitely not as angry and red anymore and feel like the patches are getting smaller. Other than Head and Shoulders this is the only scalp calming shampoo I've tried but don't feel I need to change as this seems to be helping. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,Works well and you don't need much.
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"And worrying that I now see other people have the same problem! My scalp has been burning all day. Ocado, you need to sort this out, there is a problem here! I bought shampoo and conditioner on the basis they were scalp TREATMENTS and I now cannot use them."
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,Wouldn’t recommend
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"There is nothing organic about this shampoo, which comes from america where they can label anything how they want and it is never checked.  Far worse than a dry itchy scalp, I now have dry itchy hands covered in red blotches so an ingredient in there is causing real problems.  Ocado what on earth are you doing stocking this snake oil?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"Tried it a few times, but this made my itchy scalp so much worse. Smells nice, but that's the only good thing. Such a waste of money for me, won't be using it any more."
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,you can smell that the ingredients and perfume is natural. It's like aromatherapie in the shower
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,I started using this a few weeks ago and it has really helped calm my itchy scalp. It's gentle on hair even when I shampoo twice and has a nice smell. I will buy again.
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,This shampoo has worked for me and my hair. I have only used it twice and it has completely soothed my itchy scalp. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"At first this shampoo worked great, but a few weeks on and it has stopped being effective. It is a really nice shampoo, you don't need to use much of it, but if you're prone to bad dandruff like me try something else."
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"I have been using this for a few months now and my scalp is a lot better. It does leave your hair quite dry though so you need a conditioner. Tried other brands, this is the best so far."
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"I have fairly thick, naturally curly hair and have always suffered with a dry, flaky scalp. Over the years I've tried loads of shampoos and conditioners that claim to treat this but none have worked. I have been using this shampoo with the conditioner for a couple of months and genuinely can't believe how much better my scalp is. I cannot recommend it enough. If you suffer with a dry scalp I would highly recommend this product. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,Might be a good product for some however it wasn't great for my hair. Left it dry and difficult to brush
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,Lovely product which cleans effectively and sooths an itchy scalp. Works better on dandruff than any 'medicated' shampoos.
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"Good all rounder! Have been using this shampoo for some time and have been very satisfied. It has good non-toxic ingredients, good price and does the job well. My hair is always washed well and it doesn't get greasy too soon. I wash my hair every 3-4 days. I do use a conditioner too though. Would definitely recommend."
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"After washing with this product my hair was left dull and lifeless, and was stripped of moisture, making it very difficult to comb afterwards and easy to break. it didnt do anything to relieve my itchy scalp or dandruff either. Just not worth the price."
https://www.ocado.com/products/avalon-organics-tea-tree-scalp-treatment-shampoo-84625011,"This is the best flake-reducing-itch-stopping-hair-protecting shampoo I've found. I have fine dry, curly, hair and have always had a few flakes. I've tried loads of shampoos, including pharmacy brands, and most either stop working after a while, irritate my scalp or leave my hair too dry. I have been using this (and the tea tree conditioner) a couple of years now and it's the best I've found. Even my hairdresser has commented on how healthy my hair is looking. The only downside is that Ocado seem to only stock it occasionally - hopefully upon reading this it will become a regular feature."
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,This shampoo is nice and the smell is good. It’s quite expensive for a very standard shampoo. It is nice for curly hair but it’s more an everyday shampoo than anything special.
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,"Love this shampoo - had previously been using the coconut version from this range but the banana is much better for me, my hair and scalp felt so clean. I use the curly girl method and pair it with the banana conditioner/mask and a few other styling products and it works perfectly for me!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,Smells amazing!!! I love banana. But that’s it. Doesn’t cleanse nicely and I’ve used much better SLS more natural shampoos that don’t leave my hair feeling heavy
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,I bought this and the conditioner both on half price. Even at £3 Im struggling to see how its worth it. I do quite like the clear formula but it still ends up weighing down my long hair and doesnt seem to really nourish it. I had hoped the smell would be really banana-y but its too perfumed for me. It smells a bit like if a teenage girl made a body spray. It doesnt smell very natural and doesnt really fit the branding of the product. I wouldnt buy this again.
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,"Not sure why it is called hair food, was expecting it to be thick and creamy. It is clear and runny. It smells nice and gets my hair soft and clean, would buy again but only on offer, definitely not worth £6."
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,This was nothing special and I would have been really annoyed if I paid £6 for a bottle. Luckily it was on offer.
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,"I was really impressed with this shampoo, my hair is coloured and very dry due to the damage I have inflicted on it! The fragrance is gorgeous (tropical) and perfect for summer. It left my hair feeling squeaky clean but did not dry it out or leave me with frizz. I really liked the fact it is mostly natural ingredients (98%) and silicon free. I would definitely recommend this product."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Unfortunately spoiled my red hair tones at the root, I have done a single wash  with this shampoo and  after I could see  all grey roots exposed, in fact for me did the opposite of protector.  Never again. 
I am sorry to say it!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Very well suited to coloured hair.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Really nice, leaves hair soft and glossy"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Really good shampoo!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"This is a good shampoo, like the smell and feel... Also makes my colour last"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I like this shampooooo. Not too strong smelling, lathers nicely and seems to suit my dry hair quite well."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"This smells lovely and is surprisingly mild.  I have problems with shampoo drying out my sensitive scalp, particularly in the cold weather, but no problems with this one."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Does the job, better than my usual brand."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Used this after having my hair coloured and it did help the colour last longer than usual. I tend to use a volume shampoo normally though so wouldn't swap on a permanent basis but would recommend this to lucky people with thick coloured hair!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I really like this. It's thick and easy to apply. Left my hair very soft. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I liked this shampoo so purchased the matching conditioner to go with it. My hair is quite dry, but it felt quite nice and soft after using."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Cleans well, smells great, good price. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I do have coloured hair so was looking forward to trying this shampoo, but found it made my hair greasy on repeated use."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Smells lovely, hair after wash looks shiney and are soft to touch. Easy to use. Price is good for so huge bottle.All in all very happy with this shampoo."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Not for me, as it contains silicon and I try not to use silicon products on my hair, but I passed it on to my friend who liked it!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I like that you don't need a lot of shampoo for thick hair as it lathers well. Nice smell. Left my hair feeling light and soft though i do use other products after washing my hair so hard to say of the softness is solely down to this shampoo.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I liked the smell of this product and it lathered up well. Left my hair shiny and clean.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,The smell was ok and cleaned my hair ok. It makes a lot of lather though.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I have noticed since using this shampoo that my hair dye doesn't fade. It smells nice and doesn't weigh hair down so for the price, is good for coloured hair. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Nothing out of the ordinary, but it creates a good lather which washes out easily.  Difficult to judge its anti-fade properties as there are so many other factors involved, but it is a decent product."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Although my newly coloured hair still faded at the usual rate. Nice big bottle and I personally like the fragrance.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I didn't like this shampoo. The scent is overpowering and it left my hair dry.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"The shampoo is rich and creamy and gives a nice dense lather, and it does seem to help retain my hair colour - although perhaps no more than any other brand that is designed to do this. It's certainly something I would think of ordering again at the right price! "
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I love this, does exactly what it says on the bottle. Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft, although not too soft so you can't style it, and has a great smell."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Nice shampoo, leaves hair feeling clean & soft"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Nice shampoo but doesn't get 5 stars and the smell is so strong
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I received this free in return for a review.  I wouldn't normally buy this as I don't have coloured hair but actually I was impressed with it.  Left my hair feeing clean and smelled lovely.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Leaves hair clean and soft. Lovely smell. This is a big bottle that will last for ages. Good value.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Great smelling shampoo that lasts without being too overpowering.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Lovely fragrance, feels silky smooth to apply, and gives hair a wonderful shine. Will buy again. "

https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,A lovely shampoo which produces nice looking hair
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Massive bottle so better value but nothing special to say about it except it dies the job!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Whilst there's nothing particularly remarkable about this shampoo, it cleaned my hair well.  Some shampoos for coloured hair have left me with greasy hair, but thankfully that wasn't the case with this one."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,This is quite like the other L'oreal shampoos in the range. Can't say I noticed anything special about how it affected my hair colour (although to be fair it didn't turn my highlights green!). 
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,The wife already uses this so was very happy with it 
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Super shampoo - my hair feels really clean for longer with this. My hair is much softer and silky too. My absolute favourite shampoo!!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I'm quite fussy about shampoo because I have very curly hair which is quite difficult - this was really nice, smells good and my hair felt super clean and styled really well afterwards. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,This shampoo left my hair very soft and shiny without feeling harsh.  The smell was so subtle that it wasn't really noticeable - rather a pity for me but some people might appreciate this.  It lathered up well with just one application and didn't need conditioner.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"This is a nice reasonably priced shampoo,"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I was looking forward to trying this after a previous review said it was good for frizz. I didn't use conditioner or styling products, which I normally do, and the brush went through without knots and tangles. Left hair to dry naturally and its lighter and curlier than normal with less frizz and I can run my fingers through it without them getting caught up. Genius!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"This is a great shampoo and as good as any upmarket brands. I have short, coloured hair and tend not to use conditioner and this shampoo offers plenty of moisture so all in all, great product!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Smells really nice. Makes my coloured hair smooth and shiny and not heavy. Good value for money. Would recommend.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I love this shampoo, leaves coloured hair looking really healthy but without adding weight."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I really love this shampoo.  The smell is gorgeous and seems to last through the day.  The shampoo isn't oily at all and leaves my hair really smooth.  Will definitely buy again!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I use this shampoo along with the corresponding conditioner. Together they leave my hair soft and shiny.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Was sent to review - it cleans my hair nicely and smells nice. Time will tell if it helps the colour to last longer than my usual shampoo. Would try again. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Smells good, washes out well and leaves hair looking in great condition."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Really this did what I expected it cleaned well, smelt good and left my hair smooth. Would recommend."

https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,This product is a must for coloured hair. It has a nice light smell and leaves my hair extremely soft. Great!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Having recently died my hair brown, at first I really liked the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette range -because it smells so nice- but this beats it hands down for colour protection, softness and shine."
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,Smells lovely and nice rich consistency but my fair felt lank after
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"Its meant to be root boosting but it left my hair limp, lank and greasy, and left the blond tones very dull and dark. I ended up throwing the last bit of the bottle away and switching to something else. Awful."
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"I was sent this product to review. It is an attractive looking package and a nice, effective conditioner leaving hair soft and shiny"
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,I’m reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado.  This smells lovely and leaves hair in great condition. Would buy again.
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"I am reviewing this product because I received a free sample from Ocado.
Pleasant scent. Uninspiring container which looks as if it should contain a coloured cream such as Foundation rather than a vibrant white cream it actually dispenses. Lid easy to open & shut. The quantity is smaller than im used to. Makes hair under water squeak which I think is a good thing. When hair is dry it has a fuller appearance because it is fluffy.  My hair is not thinning or fine so i am probably not the best person to comment on this product however, whilst I wont be purchasing this in future, because of my particular hair type, I do recommend this to others looking for a fuller appearance. It has left my hair feeling beautifully soft and silky."
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,I have thick hair so wasn't expecting much when I got this to try but it definitely helped with fullness and it smells lovely. Great value and I imagine it would be really effective for fine hair.

My hair is fine but I have a lot of it, its fairly long and not coloured but I swim a lot. I tend to let it dry naturally and dont use styling products.

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"Yes, it is toothpaste and it cleans teeth. But I cannot abide how much excess of froth it produces in normal use. It feels like I've triggered one of those spray cans of whipped cream in my mouth, wandering around the bathroom frothing like a rabid wolf. “But marktristan, surely you're using an excessive amount on the brush?”, you cry! Far from it, I rebut. Only a baked-bean sized blob that fits on the head of my Braun electric toothbrush, same as any normal toothpaste. The ones I'm used to – and far prefer – are Sensodyne and Ultradex. I recommend either of those instead. But suppose you want not only clean teeth and fresh breath, but also a telltale trail of froth down your chest – well, feel free to buy this. I note they also do a 3-pack, if you want the full 'foam fire extinguisher' experience."

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"I received this free for review. The colour and texture is a bit odd, sort of semi-transparent and slightly grey. Not overly grainy in use though. I found the taste to be pleasant, not too minty, I prefer less mint in toothpaste. I have very sensitive teeth and gums and it was not painful or caused any bad sensation, so for me it's a winner."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,I really didn't like the taste of this toothpaste. I tasted a plastic taste whilst brushing with it. Colgate definitely do far better tasting toothpastes than this.

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,I had no idea before I bought it that this toothpaste contained silica micro particles - how is this still being sold and why wasnt that information available before I purchased? Misleading and a waste of money.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"The ingredients list is incorrect. We bought this by mistake thinking it was similar to our usual Total toothpaste and didn't check the ingredients beforehand. When I saw the package I was alarmed to see the term ""micro cleaning particles"" which I thought were being banned if they are micro plastics. The ingredients list on the package     shows PVM/MA Copolymer which sounds like plastic to me. The list given by Ocado omits this item and shows what looks like the ingredients from regular Total without microplastics. So Ocado, why are you selling plastic microparticles and not putting them on the ingredient list?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,It tastes really bad. Tastes like moisturising cream.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,A really great toothpaste with a sharp minty flavour. Has a grainy texture  which can take a little getting used to at first but I think this adds to the 'deep clean' feeling.

https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I chose this because it has stannous fluoride, not just sodium fluoride. It doesn't taste as nice as my previous toothpaste, but I don't mind that if it's healthier for my teeth - and any initial grittiness quickly dissipates as I brush. It does however do very strange things to my cheek linings!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,This toothpaste was recommended to me by my dentist and I have to agree that I think it is the best toothpaste I have tried so far. I also like the mild flavour.

Helps keep you teeth white and I am sure it has strengthened my enamel."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,It doesn't foam up properly which means that you end up dribbling a lot more than with other toothpastes. It's also runny and gooey which means it drips off the brush and gets all mucky around the lid. And as for that gritty texture - it's like nails on a blackboard for me.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Gritty texture makes my mouth feel super clean and teeth look whiter and better than ever.  My dentist recommended this

https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Despite being cool mint flavour- just tastes really strongly of cinnamon to the point I can't use it!
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Really leaves you feeling clean and has removed any sensitivity. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Since I've stared using this toothpaste I've not used or tried any others. I really like the taste of the toothpaste as well. My teeth always feel clean after and well protected. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Will strip your mouth entirely of skin and leave you spitting white strongly mouth boogers. 
Avoid!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Good toothpaste leaves mouth pleasantly  minty fresh.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Love the taste of this. Much nicer than the usual range of mints. Also, it has a slightly grainy feel which helps to clean your teeth efficiently."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Otherwise I like it very much indeed. A repeat buy. Love the taste.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,I will not bore you with the story but this toothpaste causes horrid stringy white stuff in the mouth. Definitely down to the paste. We did try. Tastes bad too but that is another issue. Dentist confirmed that this has been caused by this particular paste and has had many other complaints about it. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Teeth are far less sensitive & genuinely feel stronger. I'm a massive sceptic of miracle 'cures' but actually this stuff is fab. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Gave up on my £9 a tube whitening toothpaste and used a sample of this from the dentist. Mouth feels clean, teeth have started looking white again, taste is different but I much prefer it. Love that my face doesn't get covered in foamy toothpaste too!  "
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Really good toothpaste, keeps my teeth nice and white and clean and my mouth feels very minty fresh afterwards."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This is my favourite toothpaste! I love the taste - it's less ""minty"" than others and has a milder flavour. I also like the fact it has an anti bacterial ingredient which keeps my mouth feeling cleaned for longer."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Love this toothpaste - even though it's double the price of my old one, now a must twice a day.  Love the gritty bits in it - always feels like you've just had a scale and polish. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Tastes fine
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"It's not a toothpaste but blue tooth gel with gritty bits. It may be good at cleaning and protecting teeth but after the one and only pea sized gel trial the whole 75ml tube has to be discarded. It has the most vile, awful medicinal taste that to make matters worse it just lingers on and on and on. After this initial trial, I used my normal branded toothpaste and also a branded mouthwash wishfully thinking this should eradicate the awful Pro-Expert flavour before jumping into the shower. How wrong I was during my shower I could still taste the strong medicinal flavoured gel to the point I had to continually spit out saliva. Two more branded toothpaste brushes later still hasn't totally eradicated it. Oral-B may well have stuck some battery acid in a tube. The Pro-Expert was a free sample, but to be honest, unless Oral-B paid me enough to retire on, I'm not touching this product again I'm afraid. One star given not because of any redeeming product feature but because I can't give zero."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Leaves teeth feeling like they have had a good clean, a minty fresh taste."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Really feel as though my teeth are lovely and clean with this toothpaste. Fresh minty taste, slightly gooey gel with a little grit.  Lasts well and my teeth are still smooth in the morning. Probably the best toothpaste I've used for ages.  Great value for money when on offer!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"A good toothpaste to use and a pleasant change from the overpowering mint most brands use. The taste is unusual but personally I like it, very hard to describe though. Clean? Medical? Regardless, the taste is gone within a minute of finishing, which is nice. The paste itself is a gel, a little gooier than other kinds and it does not produce any foam when brushing, which I also like. I do have to question the 'grit' in this stuff though, unless you have a feather soft brush I don't really see what this is adding to the whole operation.   Not a huge problem and not unpleasant though, it doesn't stick around in your mouth once you are done."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I first tried a sample of this toothpast from my dentist and really like everything about it.  Some reviewers say that they don't like the taste - I actually prefer it to the normal mint in toothpaste.  I also like the consistency and don't find it too liquid, provided I don't put water on the brush.
My hygienist says my teeth are cleaner and my gums have improved.  
What more could ask of a toothpaste?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I'm really not sure about this - it works brilliantly and the gritty bits really do work well, BUT the smell and flavour is not pleasant - I can only say that it reminds me of Tiger Balm and camphor. Both the smell and taste longer for a long time. Perhaps I'll get used to it but I'm not sure it's worth trying. Shame - I think there's another version so will give that a go. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Toothpaste did leave a clean feeling in mouth. However, the flavour was too sweet and the paste was too soft which made the cap a sloppy mess and sometimes dripped too easily from toothpaste to basin."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Look - I really want to use this toothpaste and I did like the granules. But the sickly, cloying sweetener stays in mouth for hours. It is too overpowering."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I go this as a sample from my dentist and have used it ever since.  The mini granules really help clean your teeth and I have far less work needed by the hygienist since using this.  So pleased that all the family use it, including the kids, and they haven't had any work done either!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Great taste, great clean!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Many toothpastes leave me with huge mouth ulcers. This is the only toothpaste which contains fluoride that doesnt give me ulcers. Fantastic. Thank you. From my research i think it has less unnecessary chemicals in. One happy shopper.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Received a free sample with my order, both husband and myself felt a wow factor with the refreshing and cleaning effect of this toothpaste, suffice to say it is now in my favourites!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Vintage taste with 21c powers.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I thought all toothpastes were basically the same - boy was I wrong.  I received a sample from Ocado so I decided to try it.  After using it, my teeth feel like I've just been to the dentist - all smooth and clean.  Really impressed with this toothpaste."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,...... the best toothpaste I have ever used.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"is what the dental hygienist called and she's right. It has granules for a really thorough clean, yet it protects enamel.  I enjoy the flavour too minty but not too strong."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This really is the one. 
If you mindfully brush, it gives a cleaner feeling than you get by going to a dentist.
Mouth feels fresh throughout the day too.
I use a mouthwash after brushing, and usually that feels very strong. But after brushing with this toothpaste, the mouthwash feels like water. 
This doesn't produce a lot of foam like many other toothpastes. So I think you need to make sure you brush every surface possible but its well worth it."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"Yes teeth are clean, but they also now have a strange gritty/grainy coating. There is no info on the box/tube explaining what this grit is. Will not buy again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"good value, cleans very well, refesh"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"We are a pump toothpaste family so when I purchased the packet of three, I wasn't too sure if we would use them immediately. So I stopped buying the pump version and found that the toothpaste was just as good, a nice minty taste and a fresh feeling in your mouth.  Go and buy!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"I'm reviewing this product because I got a free sample to try (thank you Ocado). We moved away from Colgate as we felt other toothpaste brands had moved on and we were advised by dentist. But that said, this does pretty much all you want from a toothpaste - just minty enough, good clean with a slightly grainier texture to the original (probably the Advanced Deep clean bit), but we like this as it feels like its cleaning much more like the brand we moved to and it also creates a good foam, moreso than usual, but more shaving-foam-like if you don't mind that. Would recommend as is great value for the multi pack and is overall pretty good."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"I’m reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado. The toothpaste has a nice flavour and leaves my mouth fresh and clean. Multipack is good value for money too,"

We normally buy the original Colgate Total - I thought this was just as good, husband didn’t think teeth felt as clean with this.  Toothpaste is a different consistency but didn’t find it grainy."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,Was sent this to review. Mouth felt fresh and clean for longer than most toothpastes.

Has a translucent look to it."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,This toothpaste is great. All white with small microbeads that feel like a nice exfoliator for one's gums and tongue. It looks pretty basic but it delivers. I got this free to review but will happily re-purchase

It was not overly minty so the children were happy to brush their teeth rather than racing to spit the paste out, which they do when it is too minty.
Love that it comes in a pack of 3."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,Nice minty taste. Leaves the mouth feeling fresh. According to the box it gives the mouth a lot of protection as well as a deep clean. Would recommend this product

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,Sent to review from Ocado - pleasantly surprised by this! Mouth feels really fresh and clean - and almost no mint flavour. Which is an amazing find as my son hates mint but has seriously outgrown the strawberry one he has been using. Thank you ocado! Id buy this again!
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"This toothpaste does everything it says it does, zingy, mouth feels fresh, teeth are whiter. Would I recommend it, yes."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"We were sent this by Ocado to review. Much better than some of the more obscure products (coal, extreme clean etc) this toothpaste isnt too strong but definitely makes your mouth feel clean."

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"I was sent this product for free in return for a review. I much prefer these types of toothpaste to the various charcoal (or other) alternatives on the market. Very good, fresh and minty -  as I would expect from Colgate."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,I was sent this to review and have only tried it for a couple of days but it does make my mouth feel fresher!
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,Received to review for free.  A decent fresh tasting toothpaste.  I have sensitive teeth so found this toothpaste a bit painful to brush with compared to my normal sensitive toothpaste.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,I got this to review and while I've used it for a few days I haven't really had a chance to asseess as longer-term benefits but very satisfied so far. My mouth feels fresh and clean after using it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"I was sent these to review. Overall a great toothpaste- deep clean, lovely minty taste. I would definitely repurchase"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,I was sent these by Ocado in exchange for an honest review. This toothpaste left my teeth feeling lovely and clean. The mint flavour is nice without being overwhelming and it foams up really nicely. This is a good value pack too.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,No issues with this. Decent price for the works.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,I really felt the difference when using this toothpaste. My teeth felt noticeably cleaner. Great fresh flavour.

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"I noticed how dry this toothpaste left my mouth and uncomfortable. after a couple of weeks my lips were so badly burnt that I had sores and cracking around the edges. It was very painful and throbbed. I finally worked out the cause after reading possible triggers by a dermatologist, stopped using the toothpaste and after 4 days my lips were back to normal. I cant believe such strong toothpaste can be purchased."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,A nice tasting toothpaste which helps with the gums and tongue - it really gives the feeling of cleanliness. The 3 pack is great value for money
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-moisturising-bath-foam-209791011,I normally like the Sanex range but I'm not overly keen on this one. It has a very strong perfume and it makes our bath super super slippy.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-moisturising-bath-foam-209791011,Cannot fault the price but although I like some other Sanex products this one smells cheap so won’t be buying again.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"Really good for those with sensitive skin.  My little ones skin is left soft, clean and happy.  no more irritations from bath time.   would definitely recommend.   "
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"I use this product as an adult. I find it an excellent body wash and last night I tried it to wash my hair (I have very dry mixed heritage hair) because I have been labouring with a very irritated, dry scaly scalp for about a week. Fantastic results. All the dry, scaliness has gone and the irritation has mostly gone. Excellent first use for this and I will reuse until completely sorted."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"The best kids bubble bath I've used, makes loads of bubbles compared to Johnsons, the smell is lovely and doesnt dry out my childrens skin"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,I have recently switched from Johnson’s Bedtime Bath to this for my two daughters. They love that it makes so many more bubbles compared to Johnson’s. The fragrance is fruity and smells lovely. I’ve taken a star off as the hole is bigger than other containers and therefore we end up using quite a lot more than I would prefer which means we get through a bottle quite quickly (perhaps this is why the bubbles are so good!).
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,Seems to be good on dry eczema prone skin and also creates a lovely bubbly bath.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"This is our standard bath product. It smells good, bubbles and foams well, and feels gentle and relatively natural."

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"I have used this on both my daughters and both times they have come out in a red, tight and itchy rash. I would certainly not recommend this for very young or sensitive skin."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"Bought myself a bottle of this after bf bought a bottle for his lad and I fell in love with the smell. Smells like a fruity yogurt, foams really well and doesn't dry my skin. Absolute bargain too. Little goes a long way as someone else said so should last a long time. Fab"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,My little girl has sensitive skin so I thought I would try this bubble bath. She came out of the bath after using it with lots of dry red patches all over her skin. It looked really bad. I never linked it to the bubble bath. The rash was gone in the morning. She had another bath with Sanex Kids and the same thing happened. I stopped using it and the rash disappeared and hasn't come back. I wouldn't recommend this for children with dry and/or sensitive skin.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,This is the standard product we use nightly for the children. They both have slightly sensitive skin but have never had any problems with this. It produces great amounts of foam and has a fresh smell. A small squirt will go a long way. It also seems to really melt the dirt off so we don't need soap as well. Great product.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"Have been using this for years with my 8 year old as he had mild eczema as a baby/toddler.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,This bodywash and bubble bath smells lovely plus it makes plenty of bubbles.  It doesn't irritate the kids skin either. Happydays
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"This bodywash smells a bit like papaya or some other fruity aroma. There's lots of it, too, so I don't feel I have to buy a new bottle almost every week."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,smells good and great as it doubles up as bubble bath and wash. have bought it few times as my sons skin get too dry with other products
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I have used Sanex products on & off for a few years.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I always buy sanex body wash and was so pleased when I saw they did a bigger pump bottle. Better value as you use less. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Great for kids (and adults) with sensitive skin. Pump dispenser makes less bathroom mess.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"This is a great all round family shower lotion.  The only downside was I was sent it to review and thought it was a moisturizer, lathered on my daughters legs and after a few minutes of trying to rub it in reread the bottle and in very small print it says shower gel."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,So pleased Sanex now have a pump! The liquid used to pour out of the other bottles. My children have sensitive skin and they have had no irritation whilst using it.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,My son has started to suffer from dry patches on his hands and body and found this helped to clear them. It was gentle on his skin and the pump container was easier to use in the shower and less slippery than the squeezy Sanex bottle.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"This is good value, I like the pump dispenser and it keeps skin healthy and moisturisered."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"My daughters have sensitive skin and we have been throgh a few different brands, but Sanex is one we always come back to. Although not aimed at children, this style bottle with the pump top actually makes it really easy for children to use when having a bath or shower without wasting half a bottle! So in my books that is a winner. We haven't had any more instances of dry skin since using it, so we are really pleased so far."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I've not used a product like this before; I was sent this one to review. I would buy it again when this one runs out - it will be a while; it's a big bottle. It's worked well on my sensitive skin and left it well moisturised; I think it will be good in the winter.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I received this product to review. The bottle and pump are solid. The pump is accurate, i.e. you can gauge how much  you want to squeeze out quite easily. It has an inoffensive, mild fragrance, more toward the clean and medical rather than luxury cosmetic, which I prefer. It doesn't foam as much as my usual Dove moisturising, but well enough. The moisturising seems ok, not too much, not a feeling of greasiness on the skin. A family shower staple."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Lovely gently shower gel with easy dispense, would buy again!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I have been using the hypoallergenic Sanex but this is friendly to my skin as well and easy to use because of the pump.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I received this to review. 
It is a large bottle and looks a bit clinical (like the rest of the range). It is slightly heavy for my shelf perhaps but it stands safely on the floor of the shower. The pump seems robust. The product is clear like a runny gel, foams up nicely and leaves a moisturised feel. The smell is quite nice (not too strong). 
I would say it is a good value family staple."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I was sent this to review. The pump dispenser worked well and the gel felt soft on my skin. I found the smell a bit medicinal and overall my impression was of a good quality, no nonsense product which worked well but was not luxurious."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Quality shower gel in a handy pump dispenser. Gentle, moisturising, with a good lather and pleasant smell."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,This is an economical shower gel and good value for everyday use. The smell is subtle and it leaves my sensitive skin feeling cleansed and moisturised. It does what it says on the tin! 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I love this, the pump top makes it easy to use, it has a pleasant smell and I can almost feel it soothing my dry skin. It is a huge bottle, so it should last for ages. Very good value."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"The packaging for this shower gel gives you sense it's going to like something you'd find in a hospital, so it was a nice surprise to find it was a very nice, delicately scented gel, that lathered well but did not dry out the skin at all.  The pump dispenser is an added bonus, making it easy to get just the right amount you need.  A definite winner!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I really can't fault this product, from the packaging /huge bottle that will last and an easy dispenser pump/ to effectiveness /felt really clean after a small amount/ to smell and feel /very delicate/.  Thoroughly recommend."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Great value as very large bottle with easy to use dispenser. Good for sensitive skin like mine
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Sent as oart of review programme, it is not an item I woukd have looked at as it sounds a little clinical, however I was very pleasantly surprised.  Large bottle which will last ages, very gentle on my dry skin which was unexpectedly good as the packaging looks so uninteresting."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Lovely product with the added bonus of being great for sensitive skins. The pump dispenser makes it extra convenient.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"The bottle is massive, which is good, so value for your money.  The pump dispenser is the added bonus, no messing around with caps and you can regulate how much you use.  People think you should get a good lather for soap to be efficient, you really dont, this cleaned well with just a small amount and not to much lather.
With a delicate smell, I really like it, it does what it says on the bottle and hydrates your dry skin, good for my sensitive skin too.  This will last me for ages, so a good size bottle for a large family.  Its a hit in this household."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"We dont have sensitive skin but I tend to shop for sensitive products as I figure theyll be kinder to skin (IMHO). This was absolutely fine for shower and bath - as its sensitive, theres no fragrance but that doesnt fuss me as I add bath oils/candles if I want aroma. Would purchase again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Was sent to review for free but have purchased this before and love it.
The easy to use pump action can be a little temperamental and I often end up squirting our across the shower but for what it is intended for, love it. Super soft, no over powering scent, feel clean and moisturised."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I have used this a couple of times now in the bath (not shower) and it foams well - acting a bit like bubble bath. Leaves skin feeling well moisturised and soft. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I was given this to review. Its a good size shower gel which is perhaps a little more liquid than I expected. Feels good on the skin with a pleasant smell although I would have preferred a bit more lather. This product is for normal to dry skin and I have extremely dry skin which may explain why my legs felt a bit dry afterwards. For most people I would say this is a very good shower gel to try.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,A good size and I like the pump dispenser. Good results for all of the family especially those with sensitive skin.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Lovely soft skin, nice smell and very convenient pump... I don’t normally buy into moisturising shower gels but this has made me think again. Great product!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Sent this to review. Product design is good, but we would prefer it without the SLS."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Already a fan of Sanex products, this one is brilliant because it has an easy to use pump dispenser.  Great"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Felt good on sensitive skin with no adverse reaction.  Nice smell.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I have sensitive skin and my husband has normal - and we are both enjoying using this. And yes the pump is really handy for dispensing.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Sent for review by Ocado. This is a lovely product especially for sensitive skin. The only downside is this gel doesn’t lather very easily so end up needing more product. The pump is very handy though. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I was sent this to review by Ocado. Its not something Id usually buy as I like a scented shower gel whereas this is more functional with a very mild, slightly medical smell. However, it does the job and left my skin feeling soft. The pump action contained is very useful to have in the shower. A good value product thatd suit the whole family."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I buy this regularly in the bottle version. Glad to have a pump dispenser as it has better control of the amount of soap. The bottle pours out too much.
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,Easy to use but the burning sensation I was left with was very unpleasant. Maybe I’ll just use it for washing my feet.
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,"Great foam as all the foamburst range have, but the best scent of any of the current ones Ive tried - very subtle bergamot and citrus for a nicely refreshing shower without smelling like a Starburst afterwards"
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,They used to do one for men but sadly have stopped so it's hit and miss trying to find one for men and this one isn't to bad would recommend
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,"I was given a can of this shower gel to review for Ocado, & Im quite
Impressed with it.  
The scent is quite subtle & pleasant whilst the foam spreads well over the body.  
My husband seems to have enjoyed using it too & finds it doesnt clog 
the drain.  
I shall put it on my next order."
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,"Great if you like a lot of foam, especially in hard water areas where it is harder to to lather."
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,I enjoy using foam gel and liked this new fragrance.
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,"The whole family really enjoyed using this. 
As mentioned, it lathers up well. Just wish the scent was a bit stronger."
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,Lovely and foamy. Little goes a long way
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,Received this to review.  When shaving applies fairly well and smell is good.  Product is a gel which turns into a foam.  Packaging and presentation good.  Use another brand for shaving which I prefer.
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,"‘I’m reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado.’
I have not used a foam shower gel before and a little goes a very long way!  This smells delightful and would definitely buy again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,"This was a product I was asked to review. You only need a small amount of this to get lots of foam, but it rinses off easily. It has a pleasant, light aroma. I had never bought it before, but would certainly consider buying it again, especially as it can be used for shaving as well."
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,You only need a very small amount as it foams up really well which means that it is fairly economical. It has a strong scent that is a little overpowering for me but my dad thinks it's great.
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,Certainly foams up and you do not need much.  Whilst not unpleasant I did not find the scent particularly invigorating.
https://www.ocado.com/products/imperial-leather-foamburst-bergamot-sea-minerals-456209011,"I was asked to review this shower foam. You only need a little bit and when you add water it seriously foams. The good thing is that it also rinses off really easily so you dont have to rub too much to get rid of the suds. 
An excellent product which I would definitely buy again."

https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,"Glad these are back! A decent size and substantial enough to apply and remove moisturising cleanser to/from face and neck, gentle and soft texture - I grab some whenever I see them."
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,These are great.  Just a cup of water by the changing mat and these are ideal instead of baby wipes when changing nappies.  They clean better than all the baby wipe brands I've tried and it's just water and no baby wipe chemicals.
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,"Would recommend these for removing make up, very soft and gentle.   Very absorbent for make up remover, return to them every time."
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,These are the best cotton pads I can find for removing make-up. I actually cut them in half to make them go a bit further as they are quite thick and do the job! Would recommend.
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,"I use it to clean my baby poo and also to freshen up her face in the morning,  very good quality. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,Purchased these for use with cleanser and toner. They are brilliant. They are so large and do not leave any cotton fluff behind. You would only need one to remove 2 whole hands of nail varnish aswell. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,These shed too much cotton to be suitable for babies. Youll see what I mean when you find yourself picking poo-soaked cotton fibres off your babys genitals at 2am!
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,"These are almost the size of a face wipe, but you can use your own cleanser on them! Previously I had to use two or three smaller size cotton pads to remove a faceful of makeup, now I just use one of these and it gets everything off! Really nice, soft texture and doesn't break or shed. Hope Ocado keeps stocking these!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,My newborn daughter loves it and we will definitely stock more!

Im not a big fan of protein powders as I normally recommend real foods to clients but this is a great way of increasing protein intake. Its the only whey powder I like."
https://www.ocado.com/products/the-organic-protein-co-madagascan-vanilla-whey-protein-powder-487273011,I've tried lots of gluten free protein powders and most have been unbearable to drink. This one however is delicious. I've tried the whole range and they are great but the vanilla is my favourite. I love that it doesn't have lots of unnatural ingredients and preservatives. I would definitely recommend. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/the-organic-protein-co-madagascan-vanilla-whey-protein-powder-487273011,"Creamy, real vanilla and no additives. Just perfect."

https://www.ocado.com/products/the-organic-protein-co-madagascan-vanilla-whey-protein-powder-487273011,I bought this powder hoping to find an organic option with good credentials. There is an overpowering taste of whey that almost wipes out the vanilla. For the price I think the taste needs improving
https://www.ocado.com/products/carex-original-handwash-17750011,Havent used carex for a while as usually get cheap big and whats on offer however this was kind of on offer. Forgotten how good it actually is. Little goes a long way and foams up a treat and although to me it didnt smell of anything much carex does give you peace of mind. Now Ive remembered how much better it foams up compared to others I may pop one in basket next time again.
https://www.ocado.com/products/carex-original-handwash-17750011,I like this as it is not perfumed. It's easy to use and lathers nicely and doesn't seem to leave my hands dry

https://www.ocado.com/products/carex-original-handwash-17750011,"Smells nice, and came on recommendation from my piercer that it could be used to clean and heal body piercings. Foams easily and you don't need too much. "

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"Yes, it is toothpaste and it cleans teeth. But I cannot abide how much excess of froth it produces in normal use. It feels like I've triggered one of those spray cans of whipped cream in my mouth, wandering around the bathroom frothing like a rabid wolf. “But marktristan, surely you're using an excessive amount on the brush?”, you cry! Far from it, I rebut. Only a baked-bean sized blob that fits on the head of my Braun electric toothbrush, same as any normal toothpaste. The ones I'm used to – and far prefer – are Sensodyne and Ultradex. I recommend either of those instead. But suppose you want not only clean teeth and fresh breath, but also a telltale trail of froth down your chest – well, feel free to buy this. I note they also do a 3-pack, if you want the full 'foam fire extinguisher' experience."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"Sample for review. Pleasant taste and texture, but I still prefer my usual Aquafresh (for the white, white smile that gets you noticed - copyright UltraBrite)."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"I received this free for review. The colour and texture is a bit odd, sort of semi-transparent and slightly grey. Not overly grainy in use though. I found the taste to be pleasant, not too minty, I prefer less mint in toothpaste. I have very sensitive teeth and gums and it was not painful or caused any bad sensation, so for me it's a winner."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,I really didn't like the taste of this toothpaste. I tasted a plastic taste whilst brushing with it. Colgate definitely do far better tasting toothpastes than this. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"Ive tried various other Colgate toothpastes in the last few months when this one has been substituted in my orders. I find that this is still the best one, Im so glad its back in stock."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Its an ok toothpaste mild mint taste but it is very gritty. I personally dont like that so wont be getting it again. I usually use the Colgate total range but wont be buying this one again .
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,For two days I thought someone had sprayed perfume on my toothbrush or somehow spilled petrol on it. Then I worked out its this toothpaste. Horrific
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,the worst tasting toothpaste I've ever experienced
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Good toothpaste and does the job but it's a fairly small tube at the price of a large one!
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Leaves mouth really fresh and is best whitening toothpaste I've found. Cant fault it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"This product leaves a load of silica microbeads on your teeth after use a horrible grittyness. This means I had to rinse my mouth after, which reduces the effectiveness I guess."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"Best toothpaste I've had in a long long time. Leaves teeth super fresh, feels like it cleans much better, than other ones."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"We have found this to be the only toothpaste where you feel your teeth are really clean and stay clean for longer. I also love the flip top cap rather than the screw on one that never gets put back between uses. One star off as full price it is really expensive compared to others, even other Colgate ones but on offer it is worth paying for."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"One of the best toothpastes that we've purchased recently. I have very sensitive gums and most deep cleaning pastes cause irritation and very dry mouth, this one didn't cause any of it. We will buy this product again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,I had no idea before I bought it that this toothpaste contained silica micro particles - how is this still being sold and why wasnt that information available before I purchased? Misleading and a waste of money.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"The ingredients list is incorrect. We bought this by mistake thinking it was similar to our usual Total toothpaste and didn't check the ingredients beforehand. When I saw the package I was alarmed to see the term ""micro cleaning particles"" which I thought were being banned if they are micro plastics. The ingredients list on the package     shows PVM/MA Copolymer which sounds like plastic to me. The list given by Ocado omits this item and shows what looks like the ingredients from regular Total without microplastics. So Ocado, why are you selling plastic microparticles and not putting them on the ingredient list?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,It tastes really bad. Tastes like moisturising cream.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,A really great toothpaste with a sharp minty flavour. Has a grainy texture  which can take a little getting used to at first but I think this adds to the 'deep clean' feeling.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,This toothpaste has a nice fresh taste and sems as effective as any other!
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Very good - a little expensive but does a good job.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Good toothpaste. Does its job! 
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"I thought as its a deep clean toothpaste my mouth would feel fresher than my normal whitening toothpaste but it didn't, just gritty. Unfortunately wouldn't buy it at that price "
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Found similar to other Colgate products but left unsure as to why so expensive
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"good flavour and clean. Others are right, a tad expensive."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,nice enough toothpaste that seems to do what the packet says and give a deep clean.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Nice to use and does the job well but expensive

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,Lovely clean feeling after using this
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"Refreshing and feels clean afterwards, but it's not for sensitive teeth."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,My husband loved this toothpaste and really felt like it did offer a deep clean between teeth. I prefer the ones with micro particles although this did the job and did feel better than a 'normal' toothpaste 
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"Teeth felt nice and clean, lovely minty taste too. Would use again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-308769011,"It leaves your mouth feeling real clean, but it is not my favourite flavour.. I prefer more subtle stuff"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Ive stupidly persevered with this for the last week and now my mouth is really sore. Something in this toothpaste causes the skin to come away from my cheeks and gums. Usually love this brand but wont be buying this one again and it will be going in the bin
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"My favourite toothpaste, but not cheap!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,These are the next best thing from prescription toothpaste. I buy a few when on offer and make sure my cupboard never runs out as it's quite pricey full price.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Of all the toothpastes out there, my dentist approved this one. Stain removing without sloughing skin off the inside of your mouth and does the same job as far more 'adavanced' ones. Never use anything else now."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This is my husband's preferred toothpaste and it seems to keep his teeth clean and cavity-free. However, the amount Ocado charge for it is daylight robbery and it can be found for nearly half the price elsewhere."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,I love the slight grittiness of this paste.  I feel it really cleans my teeth well.  I am so disappointed when I have to use anything else.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"We love this, like exfoliate for your teeth. I really like the taste too."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"A reminder never to buy again, taste like germoline. Oral B toothpastes are great but avoid this one unless you like the taste of 1970s pink antiseptic ointment"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Seems you either love or hate this toothpaste. We love the taste & gritty texture. Mouth & teeth feel very clean after using this paste, it also appears to whiten teeth better than specific teeth whitening toothpastes."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Yucky, chemical taste"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I chose this because it has stannous fluoride, not just sodium fluoride. It doesn't taste as nice as my previous toothpaste, but I don't mind that if it's healthier for my teeth - and any initial grittiness quickly dissipates as I brush. It does however do very strange things to my cheek linings!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,This toothpaste was recommended to me by my dentist and I have to agree that I think it is the best toothpaste I have tried so far. I also like the mild flavour.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This toothpaste leaves the freshest feeling in your mouth after brushing. Maybe the flavour isnt to everyones taste but I much prefer it over standard mint toothpastes, it has a more long-lasting effect and leaves my mouth feeling squeaky clean"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This toothpaste is just awful. It has a strong chemical in it that breaks down the skin on the inside of your mouth, leaving white stringy bits. It also has an awful, overly sweet taste. Definitely avoid!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,There's a sugar-y grittiness to this paste that I couldn't take to .... not recommended
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This toothpaste is the best I have found.  Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and has a nice minty taste.
Helps keep you teeth white and I am sure it has strengthened my enamel."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,It doesn't foam up properly which means that you end up dribbling a lot more than with other toothpastes. It's also runny and gooey which means it drips off the brush and gets all mucky around the lid. And as for that gritty texture - it's like nails on a blackboard for me.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Gritty texture makes my mouth feel super clean and teeth look whiter and better than ever.  My dentist recommended this
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"It actually whitened my teeth, I like the gritty texture and the taste!!
"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Not much else to say but it leaves you with a stringy white residue on your lips and youll be peeling it off halfway through the day.  Avoid it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Quite a gritty toothpaste but that does the job and leaves your teeth clean and fresh.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,One of the best toothpaste I ever used. I've noticed after 2 weeks of use that my tooths are more white than before.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Despite being cool mint flavour- just tastes really strongly of cinnamon to the point I can't use it!
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Really leaves you feeling clean and has removed any sensitivity. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Since I've stared using this toothpaste I've not used or tried any others. I really like the taste of the toothpaste as well. My teeth always feel clean after and well protected. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Will strip your mouth entirely of skin and leave you spitting white strongly mouth boogers. 
Avoid!"

https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Love the taste of this. Much nicer than the usual range of mints. Also, it has a slightly grainy feel which helps to clean your teeth efficiently."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Otherwise I like it very much indeed. A repeat buy. Love the taste.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,I will not bore you with the story but this toothpaste causes horrid stringy white stuff in the mouth. Definitely down to the paste. We did try. Tastes bad too but that is another issue. Dentist confirmed that this has been caused by this particular paste and has had many other complaints about it. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Teeth are far less sensitive & genuinely feel stronger. I'm a massive sceptic of miracle 'cures' but actually this stuff is fab. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Gave up on my £9 a tube whitening toothpaste and used a sample of this from the dentist. Mouth feels clean, teeth have started looking white again, taste is different but I much prefer it. Love that my face doesn't get covered in foamy toothpaste too!  "
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Really good toothpaste, keeps my teeth nice and white and clean and my mouth feels very minty fresh afterwards."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This is my favourite toothpaste! I love the taste - it's less ""minty"" than others and has a milder flavour. I also like the fact it has an anti bacterial ingredient which keeps my mouth feeling cleaned for longer."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Love this toothpaste - even though it's double the price of my old one, now a must twice a day.  Love the gritty bits in it - always feels like you've just had a scale and polish. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Tastes fine
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"It's not a toothpaste but blue tooth gel with gritty bits. It may be good at cleaning and protecting teeth but after the one and only pea sized gel trial the whole 75ml tube has to be discarded. It has the most vile, awful medicinal taste that to make matters worse it just lingers on and on and on. After this initial trial, I used my normal branded toothpaste and also a branded mouthwash wishfully thinking this should eradicate the awful Pro-Expert flavour before jumping into the shower. How wrong I was during my shower I could still taste the strong medicinal flavoured gel to the point I had to continually spit out saliva. Two more branded toothpaste brushes later still hasn't totally eradicated it. Oral-B may well have stuck some battery acid in a tube. The Pro-Expert was a free sample, but to be honest, unless Oral-B paid me enough to retire on, I'm not touching this product again I'm afraid. One star given not because of any redeeming product feature but because I can't give zero."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Leaves teeth feeling like they have had a good clean, a minty fresh taste."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Really feel as though my teeth are lovely and clean with this toothpaste. Fresh minty taste, slightly gooey gel with a little grit.  Lasts well and my teeth are still smooth in the morning. Probably the best toothpaste I've used for ages.  Great value for money when on offer!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"A good toothpaste to use and a pleasant change from the overpowering mint most brands use. The taste is unusual but personally I like it, very hard to describe though. Clean? Medical? Regardless, the taste is gone within a minute of finishing, which is nice. The paste itself is a gel, a little gooier than other kinds and it does not produce any foam when brushing, which I also like. I do have to question the 'grit' in this stuff though, unless you have a feather soft brush I don't really see what this is adding to the whole operation.   Not a huge problem and not unpleasant though, it doesn't stick around in your mouth once you are done."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I first tried a sample of this toothpast from my dentist and really like everything about it.  Some reviewers say that they don't like the taste - I actually prefer it to the normal mint in toothpaste.  I also like the consistency and don't find it too liquid, provided I don't put water on the brush.
My hygienist says my teeth are cleaner and my gums have improved.  
What more could ask of a toothpaste?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I'm really not sure about this - it works brilliantly and the gritty bits really do work well, BUT the smell and flavour is not pleasant - I can only say that it reminds me of Tiger Balm and camphor. Both the smell and taste longer for a long time. Perhaps I'll get used to it but I'm not sure it's worth trying. Shame - I think there's another version so will give that a go. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Toothpaste did leave a clean feeling in mouth. However, the flavour was too sweet and the paste was too soft which made the cap a sloppy mess and sometimes dripped too easily from toothpaste to basin."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Look - I really want to use this toothpaste and I did like the granules. But the sickly, cloying sweetener stays in mouth for hours. It is too overpowering."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I go this as a sample from my dentist and have used it ever since.  The mini granules really help clean your teeth and I have far less work needed by the hygienist since using this.  So pleased that all the family use it, including the kids, and they haven't had any work done either!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Great taste, great clean!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,Many toothpastes leave me with huge mouth ulcers. This is the only toothpaste which contains fluoride that doesnt give me ulcers. Fantastic. Thank you. From my research i think it has less unnecessary chemicals in. One happy shopper.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"Received a free sample with my order, both husband and myself felt a wow factor with the refreshing and cleaning effect of this toothpaste, suffice to say it is now in my favourites!"

https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"I thought all toothpastes were basically the same - boy was I wrong.  I received a sample from Ocado so I decided to try it.  After using it, my teeth feel like I've just been to the dentist - all smooth and clean.  Really impressed with this toothpaste."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,...... the best toothpaste I have ever used.
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"is what the dental hygienist called and she's right. It has granules for a really thorough clean, yet it protects enamel.  I enjoy the flavour too minty but not too strong."
https://www.ocado.com/products/oral-b-pro-expert-clean-mint-toothpaste-62656011,"This really is the one. 
If you mindfully brush, it gives a cleaner feeling than you get by going to a dentist.
Mouth feels fresh throughout the day too.
I use a mouthwash after brushing, and usually that feels very strong. But after brushing with this toothpaste, the mouthwash feels like water. 
This doesn't produce a lot of foam like many other toothpastes. So I think you need to make sure you brush every surface possible but its well worth it."

https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Used this after having my hair coloured and it did help the colour last longer than usual. I tend to use a volume shampoo normally though so wouldn't swap on a permanent basis but would recommend this to lucky people with thick coloured hair!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I really like this. It's thick and easy to apply. Left my hair very soft. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I liked this shampoo so purchased the matching conditioner to go with it. My hair is quite dry, but it felt quite nice and soft after using."

https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I like that you don't need a lot of shampoo for thick hair as it lathers well. Nice smell. Left my hair feeling light and soft though i do use other products after washing my hair so hard to say of the softness is solely down to this shampoo.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I liked the smell of this product and it lathered up well. Left my hair shiny and clean.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,The smell was ok and cleaned my hair ok. It makes a lot of lather though.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I have noticed since using this shampoo that my hair dye doesn't fade. It smells nice and doesn't weigh hair down so for the price, is good for coloured hair. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Nothing out of the ordinary, but it creates a good lather which washes out easily.  Difficult to judge its anti-fade properties as there are so many other factors involved, but it is a decent product."

https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I didn't like this shampoo. The scent is overpowering and it left my hair dry.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"The shampoo is rich and creamy and gives a nice dense lather, and it does seem to help retain my hair colour - although perhaps no more than any other brand that is designed to do this. It's certainly something I would think of ordering again at the right price! "
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I love this, does exactly what it says on the bottle. Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft, although not too soft so you can't style it, and has a great smell."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Nice shampoo, leaves hair feeling clean & soft"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Nice shampoo but doesn't get 5 stars and the smell is so strong
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I received this free in return for a review.  I wouldn't normally buy this as I don't have coloured hair but actually I was impressed with it.  Left my hair feeing clean and smelled lovely.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Leaves hair clean and soft. Lovely smell. This is a big bottle that will last for ages. Good value.

https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,A lovely shampoo which produces nice looking hair
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Massive bottle so better value but nothing special to say about it except it dies the job!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Whilst there's nothing particularly remarkable about this shampoo, it cleaned my hair well.  Some shampoos for coloured hair have left me with greasy hair, but thankfully that wasn't the case with this one."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,This is quite like the other L'oreal shampoos in the range. Can't say I noticed anything special about how it affected my hair colour (although to be fair it didn't turn my highlights green!). 
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,The wife already uses this so was very happy with it 
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Super shampoo - my hair feels really clean for longer with this. My hair is much softer and silky too. My absolute favourite shampoo!!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I'm quite fussy about shampoo because I have very curly hair which is quite difficult - this was really nice, smells good and my hair felt super clean and styled really well afterwards. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,This shampoo left my hair very soft and shiny without feeling harsh.  The smell was so subtle that it wasn't really noticeable - rather a pity for me but some people might appreciate this.  It lathered up well with just one application and didn't need conditioner.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"This is a nice reasonably priced shampoo,"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I was looking forward to trying this after a previous review said it was good for frizz. I didn't use conditioner or styling products, which I normally do, and the brush went through without knots and tangles. Left hair to dry naturally and its lighter and curlier than normal with less frizz and I can run my fingers through it without them getting caught up. Genius!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"This is a great shampoo and as good as any upmarket brands. I have short, coloured hair and tend not to use conditioner and this shampoo offers plenty of moisture so all in all, great product!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Smells really nice. Makes my coloured hair smooth and shiny and not heavy. Good value for money. Would recommend.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"I love this shampoo, leaves coloured hair looking really healthy but without adding weight."
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I really love this shampoo.  The smell is gorgeous and seems to last through the day.  The shampoo isn't oily at all and leaves my hair really smooth.  Will definitely buy again!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,I use this shampoo along with the corresponding conditioner. Together they leave my hair soft and shiny.
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,Was sent to review - it cleans my hair nicely and smells nice. Time will tell if it helps the colour to last longer than my usual shampoo. Would try again.

https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,This product is a must for coloured hair. It has a nice light smell and leaves my hair extremely soft. Great!
https://www.ocado.com/products/l-oreal-elvive-colour-protect-shampoo-26965011,"Having recently died my hair brown, at first I really liked the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette range -because it smells so nice- but this beats it hands down for colour protection, softness and shine."

Smells nice and isnt at all drying."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"Really good for those with sensitive skin.  My little ones skin is left soft, clean and happy.  no more irritations from bath time.   would definitely recommend.   "
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"I use this product as an adult. I find it an excellent body wash and last night I tried it to wash my hair (I have very dry mixed heritage hair) because I have been labouring with a very irritated, dry scaly scalp for about a week. Fantastic results. All the dry, scaliness has gone and the irritation has mostly gone. Excellent first use for this and I will reuse until completely sorted."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"The best kids bubble bath I've used, makes loads of bubbles compared to Johnsons, the smell is lovely and doesnt dry out my childrens skin"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,I have recently switched from Johnson’s Bedtime Bath to this for my two daughters. They love that it makes so many more bubbles compared to Johnson’s. The fragrance is fruity and smells lovely. I’ve taken a star off as the hole is bigger than other containers and therefore we end up using quite a lot more than I would prefer which means we get through a bottle quite quickly (perhaps this is why the bubbles are so good!).
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,Seems to be good on dry eczema prone skin and also creates a lovely bubbly bath.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"This is our standard bath product. It smells good, bubbles and foams well, and feels gentle and relatively natural."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"Not harsh at all, great stuff!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"I have used this on both my daughters and both times they have come out in a red, tight and itchy rash. I would certainly not recommend this for very young or sensitive skin."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"Bought myself a bottle of this after bf bought a bottle for his lad and I fell in love with the smell. Smells like a fruity yogurt, foams really well and doesn't dry my skin. Absolute bargain too. Little goes a long way as someone else said so should last a long time. Fab"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,My little girl has sensitive skin so I thought I would try this bubble bath. She came out of the bath after using it with lots of dry red patches all over her skin. It looked really bad. I never linked it to the bubble bath. The rash was gone in the morning. She had another bath with Sanex Kids and the same thing happened. I stopped using it and the rash disappeared and hasn't come back. I wouldn't recommend this for children with dry and/or sensitive skin.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,This is the standard product we use nightly for the children. They both have slightly sensitive skin but have never had any problems with this. It produces great amounts of foam and has a fresh smell. A small squirt will go a long way. It also seems to really melt the dirt off so we don't need soap as well. Great product.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"Have been using this for years with my 8 year old as he had mild eczema as a baby/toddler. Now use it for both 8 year old and 8 month old, just one bottle in the bathroom that can be used for baths and showers - excellent."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,This bodywash and bubble bath smells lovely plus it makes plenty of bubbles.  It doesn't irritate the kids skin either. Happydays
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,"This bodywash smells a bit like papaya or some other fruity aroma. There's lots of it, too, so I don't feel I have to buy a new bottle almost every week."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-kids-head-to-toe-wash-55476011,smells good and great as it doubles up as bubble bath and wash. have bought it few times as my sons skin get too dry with other products

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,"I'm reviewing this product because I got a free sample to try (thank you Ocado). We moved away from Colgate as we felt other toothpaste brands had moved on and we were advised by dentist. But that said, this does pretty much all you want from a toothpaste - just minty enough, good clean with a slightly grainier texture to the original (probably the Advanced Deep clean bit), but we like this as it feels like its cleaning much more like the brand we moved to and it also creates a good foam, moreso than usual, but more shaving-foam-like if you don't mind that. Would recommend as is great value for the multi pack and is overall pretty good."

Id buy this again!

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,Received to review for free.  A decent fresh tasting toothpaste.  I have sensitive teeth so found this toothpaste a bit painful to brush with compared to my normal sensitive toothpaste.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,I got this to review and while I've used it for a few days I haven't really had a chance to asseess as longer-term benefits but very satisfied so far. My mouth feels fresh and clean after using it.

It was very painful and throbbed. I finally worked out the cause after reading possible triggers by a dermatologist, stopped using the toothpaste and after 4 days my lips were back to normal. I cant believe such strong toothpaste can be purchased."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-total-advanced-deep-clean-toothpaste-427011011,A nice tasting toothpaste which helps with the gums and tongue - it really gives the feeling of cleanliness. The 3 pack is great value for money
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I have used Sanex products on & off for a few years. Unfortunately had an allergic reaction to an ingredient in this product, skin was itchy with a red rash and has left me with very dry itchy skin! Wouldnt recommend this product."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,This was fine for adults but gave my kids  dry itchy patches. So not really family friendly.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Given this to review and pleasantly surprised.  Not keen on clinical appearance of the product but thats not a major issue, in fact pump applicator is quite handy in the shower. Leaves skin soft, clean and hydrated."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I always buy sanex body wash and was so pleased when I saw they did a bigger pump bottle. Better value as you use less. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Great for kids (and adults) with sensitive skin. Pump dispenser makes less bathroom mess.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,My partner has eczema and he really liked this. I thought it was great too. Good value.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"This is a great all round family shower lotion.  The only downside was I was sent it to review and thought it was a moisturizer, lathered on my daughters legs and after a few minutes of trying to rub it in reread the bottle and in very small print it says shower gel."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,So pleased Sanex now have a pump! The liquid used to pour out of the other bottles. My children have sensitive skin and they have had no irritation whilst using it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"doesnt dry my dry skin out! good, large size bottle with easy dispenser."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Doesnt dry the skin out. Excellent for eczema.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,My son has started to suffer from dry patches on his hands and body and found this helped to clear them. It was gentle on his skin and the pump container was easier to use in the shower and less slippery than the squeezy Sanex bottle.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"This is good value, I like the pump dispenser and it keeps skin healthy and moisturisered."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"My daughters have sensitive skin and we have been throgh a few different brands, but Sanex is one we always come back to. Although not aimed at children, this style bottle with the pump top actually makes it really easy for children to use when having a bath or shower without wasting half a bottle! So in my books that is a winner. We haven't had any more instances of dry skin since using it, so we are really pleased so far."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I've not used a product like this before; I was sent this one to review. I would buy it again when this one runs out - it will be a while; it's a big bottle. It's worked well on my sensitive skin and left it well moisturised; I think it will be good in the winter.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I received this product to review. The bottle and pump are solid. The pump is accurate, i.e. you can gauge how much  you want to squeeze out quite easily. It has an inoffensive, mild fragrance, more toward the clean and medical rather than luxury cosmetic, which I prefer. It doesn't foam as much as my usual Dove moisturising, but well enough. The moisturising seems ok, not too much, not a feeling of greasiness on the skin. A family shower staple."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Lovely gently shower gel with easy dispense, would buy again!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I have been using the hypoallergenic Sanex but this is friendly to my skin as well and easy to use because of the pump.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I received this to review. 
It is a large bottle and looks a bit clinical (like the rest of the range). It is slightly heavy for my shelf perhaps but it stands safely on the floor of the shower. The pump seems robust. The product is clear like a runny gel, foams up nicely and leaves a moisturised feel. The smell is quite nice (not too strong). 
I would say it is a good value family staple."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I was sent this to review. The pump dispenser worked well and the gel felt soft on my skin.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,This is an economical shower gel and good value for everyday use. The smell is subtle and it leaves my sensitive skin feeling cleansed and moisturised. It does what it says on the tin! 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I love this, the pump top makes it easy to use, it has a pleasant smell and I can almost feel it soothing my dry skin. It is a huge bottle, so it should last for ages. Very good value."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"The packaging for this shower gel gives you sense it's going to like something you'd find in a hospital, so it was a nice surprise to find it was a very nice, delicately scented gel, that lathered well but did not dry out the skin at all.  The pump dispenser is an added bonus, making it easy to get just the right amount you need.  A definite winner!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I really can't fault this product, from the packaging /huge bottle that will last and an easy dispenser pump/ to effectiveness /felt really clean after a small amount/ to smell and feel /very delicate/.  Thoroughly recommend."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Great value as very large bottle with easy to use dispenser. Good for sensitive skin like mine
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Sent as oart of review programme, it is not an item I woukd have looked at as it sounds a little clinical, however I was very pleasantly surprised.  Large bottle which will last ages, very gentle on my dry skin which was unexpectedly good as the packaging looks so uninteresting."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Lovely product with the added bonus of being great for sensitive skins. The pump dispenser makes it extra convenient.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"The bottle is massive, which is good, so value for your money.  The pump dispenser is the added bonus, no messing around with caps and you can regulate how much you use.  People think you should get a good lather for soap to be efficient, you really dont, this cleaned well with just a small amount and not to much lather.
With a delicate smell, I really like it, it does what it says on the bottle and hydrates your dry skin, good for my sensitive skin too.  This will last me for ages, so a good size bottle for a large family.  Its a hit in this household."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"We dont have sensitive skin but I tend to shop for sensitive products as I figure theyll be kinder to skin (IMHO). This was absolutely fine for shower and bath - as its sensitive, theres no fragrance but that doesnt fuss me as I add bath oils/candles if I want aroma. Would purchase again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Was sent to review for free but have purchased this before and love it.
The easy to use pump action can be a little temperamental and I often end up squirting our across the shower but for what it is intended for, love it. Super soft, no over powering scent, feel clean and moisturised."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I have used this a couple of times now in the bath (not shower) and it foams well - acting a bit like bubble bath. Leaves skin feeling well moisturised and soft. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I was given this to review. Its a good size shower gel which is perhaps a little more liquid than I expected. Feels good on the skin with a pleasant smell although I would have preferred a bit more lather. This product is for normal to dry skin and I have extremely dry skin which may explain why my legs felt a bit dry afterwards. For most people I would say this is a very good shower gel to try.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,A good size and I like the pump dispenser. Good results for all of the family especially those with sensitive skin.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Lovely soft skin, nice smell and very convenient pump... I don’t normally buy into moisturising shower gels but this has made me think again. Great product!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"Sent this to review. Product design is good, but we would prefer it without the SLS."

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Felt good on sensitive skin with no adverse reaction.  Nice smell.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I have sensitive skin and my husband has normal - and we are both enjoying using this. And yes the pump is really handy for dispensing.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,Sent for review by Ocado. This is a lovely product especially for sensitive skin. The only downside is this gel doesn’t lather very easily so end up needing more product. The pump is very handy though. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,"I was sent this to review by Ocado. Its not something Id usually buy as I like a scented shower gel whereas this is more functional with a very mild, slightly medical smell. However, it does the job and left my skin feeling soft. The pump action contained is very useful to have in the shower. A good value product thatd suit the whole family."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biomeprotect-moisturising-shower-gel-454228011,I buy this regularly in the bottle version. Glad to have a pump dispenser as it has better control of the amount of soap. The bottle pours out too much.
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,"Glad these are back! A decent size and substantial enough to apply and remove moisturising cleanser to/from face and neck, gentle and soft texture - I grab some whenever I see them."
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,These are great.  Just a cup of water by the changing mat and these are ideal instead of baby wipes when changing nappies.  They clean better than all the baby wipe brands I've tried and it's just water and no baby wipe chemicals.
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,"Would recommend these for removing make up, very soft and gentle.   Very absorbent for make up remover, return to them every time."
https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,These are the best cotton pads I can find for removing make-up. I actually cut them in half to make them go a bit further as they are quite thick and do the job! Would recommend.

https://www.ocado.com/products/babykind-giant-cotton-pads-68787011,Purchased these for use with cleanser and toner. They are brilliant. They are so large and do not leave any cotton fluff behind. You would only need one to remove 2 whole hands of nail varnish aswell.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-moisturising-bath-foam-209791011,I normally like the Sanex range but I'm not overly keen on this one. It has a very strong perfume and it makes our bath super super slippy.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sanex-biome-protect-moisturising-bath-foam-209791011,Cannot fault the price but although I like some other Sanex products this one smells cheap so won’t be buying again.

https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"Its meant to be root boosting but it left my hair limp, lank and greasy, and left the blond tones very dull and dark. I ended up throwing the last bit of the bottle away and switching to something else. Awful."

https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"I am reviewing this product because I received a free sample from Ocado.
Pleasant scent. Uninspiring container which looks as if it should contain a coloured cream such as Foundation rather than a vibrant white cream it actually dispenses. Lid easy to open & shut. The quantity is smaller than im used to. Makes hair under water squeak which I think is a good thing. When hair is dry it has a fuller appearance because it is fluffy.  My hair is not thinning or fine so i am probably not the best person to comment on this product however, whilst I wont be purchasing this in future, because of my particular hair type, I do recommend this to others looking for a fuller appearance. It has left my hair feeling beautifully soft and silky."
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,I have thick hair so wasn't expecting much when I got this to try but it definitely helped with fullness and it smells lovely. Great value and I imagine it would be really effective for fine hair.
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,I received this as a star reviewer and was pleasantly surprised. I have curly hair and after using this product it did make my curls appear more defined and curlier.

https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"Received this to review. I usually use a more expensive conditioner to add volume to my fine hair, but was impressed with this product - it not only added volume, it left my hair feeling great and looking shiny. It also smells lovely!"

She reported back & said it was ok, but she preferred cheaper brands"
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,I was sent a sample of this to review. It has a nice smell and left my coloured hair smooth and manageable. Much cheaper than my usual brand. I think Im converted!
https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,Sent by Ocado to review. My hair felt beautifully soft as soon as I applied this conditioner and it smelt lovely. I would buy this conditioner myself.

https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"I was sent this to try. Ive got fine, uncoloured hair but it can be a little dry on the ends. The conditioner smells nice and my hair was soft after but, as with a lot of conditioners the day after, I found my hair a little lank. It was as though it was too heavy for my hair. Might use it on the ends only as the roots seems okay."

https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-hair-biology-full-vibrant-conditioner-488799011,"I was sent this by Ocado to review. My hair is fine but I have a lot of it, its fairly long and not coloured but I swim a lot. I tend to let it dry naturally and dont use styling products. Anyone with hair like mine knows the endless quest for a bit of body in the length and volume at the roots. This has given my hair both. My hair looks much fuller and thicker. Im hoping that I can also achieve the other holy grail of not having to wash my hair every day. Fingers crossed!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,This shampoo is nice and the smell is good. It’s quite expensive for a very standard shampoo. It is nice for curly hair but it’s more an everyday shampoo than anything special.
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,"Love this shampoo - had previously been using the coconut version from this range but the banana is much better for me, my hair and scalp felt so clean. I use the curly girl method and pair it with the banana conditioner/mask and a few other styling products and it works perfectly for me!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,Smells amazing!!! I love banana. But that’s it. Doesn’t cleanse nicely and I’ve used much better SLS more natural shampoos that don’t leave my hair feeling heavy
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,I bought this and the conditioner both on half price. Even at £3 Im struggling to see how its worth it. I do quite like the clear formula but it still ends up weighing down my long hair and doesnt seem to really nourish it. I had hoped the smell would be really banana-y but its too perfumed for me. It smells a bit like if a teenage girl made a body spray. It doesnt smell very natural and doesnt really fit the branding of the product. I wouldnt buy this again.
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,"Not sure why it is called hair food, was expecting it to be thick and creamy. It is clear and runny. It smells nice and gets my hair soft and clean, would buy again but only on offer, definitely not worth £6."
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,This was nothing special and I would have been really annoyed if I paid £6 for a bottle. Luckily it was on offer.
https://www.ocado.com/products/garnier-ultimate-blends-nourishing-hair-food-banana-shampoo-for-dry-hair-502341011,"I was really impressed with this shampoo, my hair is coloured and very dry due to the damage I have inflicted on it! The fragrance is gorgeous (tropical) and perfect for summer. It left my hair feeling squeaky clean but did not dry it out or leave me with frizz. I really liked the fact it is mostly natural ingredients (98%) and silicon free. I would definitely recommend this product."

So when it was on offer I ordered her two cans. However we now find that one of them is faulty, the cream wont come out. But when I tried to get a refund it seems its too late (six weeks). So 4 stars for the cream 1 star for the dispenser and lack of refund!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"I find it very difficult to moisturise my lower legs, so this is a brilliant idea. I can spray them and done! If you use a lot though it wont last very long, so as much as I love it, I would only buy when its on offer."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Oh boy! This is nice. Smells like summer. Going to try the coconut version next. Im usually allergic to everything that isnt used for skin care in a hospital. Not this. 
Goes on well - Ive never done the whole moisturise after showering thing as the lotions and potions stuck my clothes to my skin and I ended up feeling like an oven ready chicken. But this I can do. 
Take care not to hold down the trigger too much or it runs off you like water. It will work out expensive - its four times the price of normal lotion, but you can use the normal bottle stuff when youre not bothered about your dry clean only clothes."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Super easy to apply, only thing is I got through my last one very quickly."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"This is perfect for moisturizing your back when you live alone. I use a rubber-ended spatula to smooth it out and it dries fast. It even worked holding the bottle upside down to reach the lower back! The best thing is that it does not point out if you have put on weight and it does not talk back, as a human help does. :-)"
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Easy to spray, light and not greasy. A perfect light moisturiser for people that find moisturising a chore. Smells lovely and fresh too."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Nice & light, makes me look after my skin more because it’s quick. Spray did go funny into more of a shoot when it’s started to empty but I like the product."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Light moisturiser, easy to absorb, but doesn't provide enough protection for the drier winter weather. I used mine almost daily, but to my surprise that in just over 2 weeks I finished the bottle already. The similar E45 spray lasts so much longer and provides better protection."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,So very moisturising. A nice fragrance  as well.
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Very handy spray can, moisturises well, and not too strong a smell! The can makes a weird noise when you spray it but otherwise this is a great lotion for the hot summer days. Its light and not sticky."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,This is great - so easy to apply and dries really quickly. Love the gentle aloe smell too! Definitely will repurchase.
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"This is great when I dont have much time to get ready in the mornings - quick spritz on after the shower, rubs in easily, provides a good long-lasting moisturisation and has a lovely clean fresh smell."

https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Nice enough as a moisturiser if you are a vasaline fan. Be careful with the overspray though, makes for Very slippery floors!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"I love this product as I need something to apply very quickly in the morning and wear tight jeans straight after. It does what it says on the Tin and smells lovely and fresh, great as I don't like sweet heavy smells, just like cooling aftersun. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"To the previous reviewer, I would suggest the cocoa version as the smell is warm and sweet but not overpowering. This one's a nice fresh summer fragrance though.  Really can't understand why anyone wouldn't buy these products. Some reviewers have said they're too light as a body moisturiser. Personally I don't want to slather on a heavy product when rushing to get ready for work. I want to spray and get dressed straight away. All variations of this product are great for everyday body moisturisation. I love them."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vaseline-intensive-care-aloe-spray-moisturiser-95241011,"Quite like the product although you do have to rub it in, you cannot just spray it on and go!  The Aloe one is ok but smells more like cucumber which I don't really like so I am going to try the Oat extract."
https://www.ocado.com/products/aussie-3-minute-miracle-shine-deep-treatment-hair-mask-83290011,This is no different to the normal shine conditioner which I use everyday.

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,Given this to review by Ocado. Pleasant flavour toothpaste that left my teeth feeling very clean. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and find it effective at cleaning but it is too soon to comment on its whitening ability. It isn't cheap so I'll only be buying this again if I find it actually impacts the whiteness of my teeth.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,I’m reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado. After 3 weeks of use I do think my teeth might look a tiny bit brighter but nothing amazing. I find the flavour not to my taste and the blue colour does end up on towels/around the sink when my eldest daughter uses it - shes not a fan of the taste either so stopped using it. I like the lid on the tube and that it can be recycled but I wouldnt buy this again.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"nice enough, but £12?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"Sent to review it does seem to be whitening, but slowly and at the price it seems a little luxury we wouldnt follow up

Overall, it is a good product which does result in a subtle lightening of the teeth without any increase in sensitivity.  The results are not dramatic, but I did not expect those sorts of results in an over the counter product.  It probably does stain protect because I have noticed a lighter shade despite everyday coffee drinking and the occasional glass or 2 of red wine.  The taste is minty and pleasant but lathers up quite a bit more than my usual toothpaste.

I would recommend it, but it is quite pricey when there is no discount."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"I was sent this to review by Ocado and was very sceptical. However, I am a big coffee drinker and my teeth - after a fortnight of using it - are noticeably whiter. I will be purchasing once this tube runs out."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,This has a great taste and my teeth are definitely looking whiter.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"I received this from Ocado to review, its a nice toothpaste but I didnt notice any whitening effect. If I bought it full price I wouldnt be to impressed. Also unnecessary plastic packaging seems wasteful."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"I was sent this by Ocado to review. I found that this toothpaste caused a lot of sensitivity and had to go back to my usual brand Sensodyne. I didn’t find that this toothpaste really whitened my teeth at all, definitely would not pay anymore then £3 for this item, let alone over £10."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,This toothpaste is way to expensive. I bought into it because of the peroxide ingredient hoping it would definitely show some sort of  whitening affect-no it didn’t. Tastes nice and fresh and my teeth did feel squeaky clean but other Colgate toothpastes do that as well. If it had whitened my teeth I would of been more willing to think it was worth it. And the packaging is way over the top I’d rather have a product that does what it claims and come in a paper bag than a disappointing product in a fancy packaging and pay £12!!!!
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"I am reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado.  I have started using this a couple of weeks ago but have not seen any whitening rests yet. As I am required to write the review within a certain time frame,  I may yet to see the results after a longer period of regular use. But after only 2 weeks I cannot comment on its effectiveness in whitening the teeth. It definitely leaves teeth nice, clean and shiny."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"Very expensive (£12) when not free to review or half price on offer. It seems the whitening benefits will only be apparent after 7 weeks. The packaging says 3 shades lighter but the small print says this takes the 7 weeks. Unfortunately as a family of 4, it will be gone by then so well never know! My  daughter says the toothpaste has weird bits in it but the rest of us found it to be fine- blue and minty! A lot of unnecessary packaging to try and make this look like a premium product worth paying for. I would prefer it to be a bit cheaper and come in a cardboard box!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,This toothpaste was given to my by Ocado to review. Its mintier than many other brands of whitening toothpaste. Ive used this continuously since receiving. It and havent noticed much difference to the whiteness of my teeth but they do feel super clean
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"Received a sample from ocado. The toothpaste  itself is ok, nice minty flavour although it does feel like it goes slightly warm when you first brush which is a little strange. Weve been using it twice daily for a week and no noticeable difference yet but it does say 3 weeks so well see. Not sure I will continue with it once it runs out at £12 a tube though."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-expert-anti-stain-whitening-toothpaste-500652011,"Im reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado. 
This toothpaste at full price is incredibly expensive at £12. 
The packaging almost reflects this as its not supplied in a traditional cardboard tube instead its almost herod in a open box with a plastic sleeve surrounding it. 
The product claims to make teeth 3 shades whiter in 8 weeks so time will tell with regular use and I understand it does this through a integrated whitening agent. 
You wouldnt taste it however, the product itself tastes like a strong minty toothpaste and my mouth does feel clean and fresh after using it. 
Would I buy it regularly? Well Ive taken a picture of my teeth today and Ill compare it to another picture in 8 weeks time.!! 
My gut tells me however the difference will be minimal and Ill end up buying my £2 toothpaste again soon"

https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-derma-spa-summer-revived-fair-to-medium-gradual-self-tan-293795011,I have applied it twice now with a fortnight in between and it gives a very natural even colour. I will be using it always!
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-derma-spa-summer-revived-fair-to-medium-gradual-self-tan-293795011,"This lotion rubs in really nicely, provides good moisturisation and has a really pleasant smell. Yes the smell is quite strong when first applied but its not an unpleasant fake-tan smell unlike lots of other similar products and the smell doesnt last long. Ive only taken a star off as I didnt really see much of a change in colour on first application. It took 3 days to see a subtle tan developing, but it is a nice colour and isnt patchy or streaky. If you are after a strong tan this isnt for you, but if you want a subtle bronze glow then its great."

Worth using all year just for that!  It took 3 days to show a faint tan but it did start to take on a faint orange hue to it at that point on my shin bones for some reason.  Otherwise it has a nice faint brown colour.

https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-derma-spa-summer-revived-fair-to-medium-gradual-self-tan-293795011,Too pale for me. Although the fragrance was pleasant enough to begin with it really lingered which also put me off.

Would buy again but I wouldn't use for best, just maybe top up during the week!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-derma-spa-summer-revived-fair-to-medium-gradual-self-tan-293795011,"I use this as top-up after I already have a natural tan, because it does not work at all on any white bits. 
Like the smell, but would like it to be more moisturizing"
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-derma-spa-summer-revived-fair-to-medium-gradual-self-tan-293795011,By far the best everyday tanning product I've used and I've paid for far more expensive brands. I like the fact that it needs very little ribbing in and it hasn't streaked. The  colour is most like my natural tan. Try it!

https://www.ocado.com/products/e45-rich-24h-moisturiser-lotion-for-dry-skin-pump-421464011,I liked this cream and the fact that even though it has the evening primrose oil it doesn't have a scent. Its a little silky and takes a while to set in but overall seems good.

I do think they may be a little less absorbant, but they're good enough for my needs. Would genuinely consider buying in future, being more environmentally friendly is a bonus."

https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,I got these to review and gave them to my 93 year old Aunt to try. She said they were soft and comfortable and kept her dry.
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,"I was given these by Ocado in return for a review.  These come in a small, neat box and are individually wrapped, which may be a bonus for some users.  Once I got one out of the plastic wrap, which was difficult to remove,  I managed to attach the first oine to my hand and jumper.  I was more careful with the second and it did the job surprisingly well.  No perfume and a none-nappy feel are my main criteria and this meets both.  I would definitely buy again, but not at the full price, which I think rather high."
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,Sent to review and gave to my Tena obsessed mum. We expected these to not equally deliver but they did and felt super soft too
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,"These are individually wrapped and were not easy to open.  I had to tear open the wrapping and found the sticky protective strip came off with the wrapper.  So the first pad got all stuck together and thrown before I even used it.  Depending on how you use them will depend if theyre good for you.  They are good if you stick them to your underwear first.  This is because they are very soft and bend at the slightest movement.  But this was also the good bit about them, they are very soft and comfortable to wear, more so than other well known brands. 

It could be that the pack I had was unusually stuck very well causing problems.  So I would buy these again for when I suffer soreness.

I received a free packet from Ocado to review."
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,Given these to review I was surprised how thin they are. But they do the job for lighter issues and are comfortable and soft.
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,I was given these to review. I usually use Tena. Both are good but these are made of more natural fibres so are a good alternative
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,"Although her favourite is the long pads, my mother in law really enjoyed these as well, and much prefers them to commercial alternatives that she says feel like plastic nappies."
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,"Found these to be very good, wings may be not quite as adhesive as other brands but will regularly buy again"
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-normal-502485011,"I bought these for my cousin who is in her late 30s and has had 4 kids. They have a trampoline their backyard and naturally the issue came up!! After her fourth, she said she needs these kinds of products more and more. I bought the whole Glo line for her as I use the Flo sanitary products. She reports back positively and says these are good for daytime. And of course the benefit is that these are natural and soft and thin rather than the thick plastic 'nappies' she'd usually use."

https://www.ocado.com/products/john-frieda-frizz-ease-dream-curls-air-dry-waves-styling-foam-274733011,"I like this product so much that I felt I had to balance the 1 star reviews! I have unruly ""crazy cat lady"" hair. I normally have to straighten it if I want to be presentable in public. During lockdown I wanted to give my hair a chance to recover without frightening my husband too much with my mad natural look. I've realised that oils etc don't do anything to tame the waywardness of newly washed, unstraightened tresses. But this foam does! I can't say it totally fixes problem hair - nothing does that in my experience (not even expensive keratin treatments). But since using the Dream Curls shampoo and conditioner, then applying this product alone (not alongside oils or spritzes) my natural, unstraightened hair is less crazy, more manageable, and I'm not embarrassed to be seen au naturel. This is a first for me. Oh and, unlike some previous reviewers, I haven't noticed an unpleasant fragrance. If you despair for your hair (as I did) it's got to be worth a try."
https://www.ocado.com/products/john-frieda-frizz-ease-dream-curls-air-dry-waves-styling-foam-274733011,"I have used this several times since buying it a week or so ago.  I would give it 5 stars for the lovely soft, non-crunchy, waves, which is just what I want BUT the 'perfume'?? It stinks.  Could it be a bad batch?  It smells like someone urinated in the bottle, to be frank.  Once it dries, the small almost dissipates but if it gets damp again - drizzle, working out - the smell is back.  I would try another bottle but am nervous that it would be exactly the same, at £7 a pop.  "
https://www.ocado.com/products/john-frieda-frizz-ease-dream-curls-air-dry-waves-styling-foam-274733011,"Bought desperately looking for a solution to a bad cut and need to control the frizz only to find, like a previous buyer that it flattened my hair but didn't quite get rid of the frizz. This would have been worth a few more stars were it not for the awful smell. Might just be me, but I can't wait to wash it out."
https://www.ocado.com/products/john-frieda-frizz-ease-dream-curls-air-dry-waves-styling-foam-274733011,"Don't even hesitate! If you have curly hair and like me, are fed up with random flat patches and mouses that leave your hair crunchy then, this stuff is absolutely amazing. Off on holiday and my hair is wet most of the time so, curlers and straighteners are pointless. This is a miracle! Just pump a little in the hair and leave it to dry naturally, so simple I'm in awe. Curls are natural and perfectly soft. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/john-frieda-frizz-ease-dream-curls-air-dry-waves-styling-foam-274733011,"I already have natural gentle waves and I'm not a friend of the hair dryer so I thought this product would be perfect for defining and adding some needed shine to my hair. Nope!! The product just made my hair straight, straight, straight - not good..."
https://www.ocado.com/products/john-frieda-frizz-ease-dream-curls-air-dry-waves-styling-foam-274733011,"I have been using Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse for quite a few years now. As I have fine wavy dry hair that doesn't like heavy products I have always struggled to find something suitable. The mousse was ok but left my hair a bit crunchy and wet looking in some areas. This product, however, is perfect! I use more than the 2-3 pumps they advise - more like 5 for my shoulder length hair, but it's great. I scrunch it into my wet hair and just leave it. No hot hair dryer and it leaves my hair looking natural and frizz free. Perfect if you want a natural unfussy look!"

https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,Somehow the geranium and rose smell in this product seems to have been removed and replaced by something like old biscuit. I've been buying this for years but not any longer.
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,Disappointed it is a plastic bottle. Had hoped for glass. I know glass is not ideal in the bath & shower but was gifting this to an eco friend and I didn't notice that it wasn't glass when I bought it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"Honestly, the smell made me feel like I should be in my 80s as it was a Grandma smell, but nice enough if you like it. Very expensive though, IMO."
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,Smells lovely but not worth it at full price.
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"This has quite a ""floral"" fragrance, which might not be to everyone's liking. The consistency is more like an oil or liquid than a gel, although it's not greasy at all, and this makes it feel a bit more luxurious. It's a bit of a treat really, it won't be replacing my everyday shower gel as quite often I just need something that can be quickly whacked onto a sponge, whereas I feel this product should be used more sparingly and applied by hand. For me, probably more suitable for relaxing in the bath than having a quick shower. It is quite pricey but hopefully with sparing use it will last a good while."
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"Very fragrant and pleasant shower gel, a real treat!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,Little goes a long way with this beautifully smelly shower gel. A real treat.
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"I received this as a gift and it's a perfectly nice, gentle product and I certainly like Neal's Yard in general. I wouldn't say it's my favourite scent, but nor is it unpleasant - just not particularly exciting. I also can't honestly say I find it vastly better than cheaper alternatives."
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"This smells lovely and is a wonderful treat for the shower, low tox ingredients are great too, but is pricey!"

https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"Same Neals Yard quality I expect from their products. Shame its in a plastic bottle, would be nicer (and more environmentally friendly) if in a glass bottle. Gorgeous smell. I dont think I would justify spending £14 on this unless a present for a friend perhaps."
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"Smells great to me but my husband is not keen on the floral smell. He also doesn't like that it's more like a cleansing oil, i.e. it doesn't lather the same as normal soap but it still cleans well. I like it, but it's too pricey. If you have the money, go for it, but for me, it's back to Aveeno I go!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"Nice product. Not overly keen on the fragrance, although quite subtle. Too expensive."
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"I really like Neals Yard products. The scent is lovely and fresh smelling. 
However, it is a relatively small bottle for the price and I feel a little duped that this is in a plastic bottle. Other products I've bought have been in glass bottles which are more pleasing, particularly if given as a gift. I feel it's too expensive for what it is, particularly now it's in a plastic bottle. Big mistake making that switch in my opinion."
https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011,"This smells great, and creates a really good lather.  But I could never justify buying this on a regular basis because of the price (unless Id won the lottery).  If it was about £4 I might get this as a treat once in a while, but £14 is far too much.  Product = 10/10.  Price 0/10."

https://www.ocado.com/products/neal-s-yard-rose-geranium-shower-gel-59504011," I tried this product today for the first time. I have to say I am pretty indifferent to it. I don't love it but neither do I hate it, but I wouldn't pay that price for it."
https://www.ocado.com/products/radox-detox-therapy-bath-salts-487394011,"On the whole I love radox products, including other bath salts in the range, but I really couldnt get on board with the smell of these. As someone else said, it smells like a cheap toilet air freshener. Quite artificial and overpowering"
https://www.ocado.com/products/radox-detox-therapy-bath-salts-487394011,This has a light sweet berry scent. I decant it into a jar and the scent makes the bathroom smell really fresh until its all used up.
https://www.ocado.com/products/radox-detox-therapy-bath-salts-487394011,I received this as a substitute. It smells like really bad toilet spray. Won't use.
https://www.ocado.com/products/radox-detox-therapy-bath-salts-487394011,Nicely scented.  Fruity but perfumed.  Dissolves really easily due to the small size of grains and doesnt colour the water. Sometimes I  leave  the bag slightly open to scent the bathroom during the day.
https://www.ocado.com/products/radox-detox-therapy-bath-salts-487394011,These bath salts have a subtle smell and leave my skin feeling really soft to the point that I'm tempted not to moisturise.  I would recommend this product.
https://www.ocado.com/products/radox-detox-therapy-bath-salts-487394011,"Nice scent and very perfumey. I don't mind it, but these types of salts I wouldn't use all the time due to some of its ingredients. "

Ive followed the instructions and applied daily and can see its working already. For an over the counter, no fuss treatment Id definitely recommend. Only downside is the 4 weeks of daily application but Ill persevere as my toe nails were infected and didnt look great with cloudy patches. Smaller nails are looking clearer and wont take too long. After its all gone Ill reapply periodically as wouldnt want it to return. Bottle is small but itll last for ages."
https://www.ocado.com/products/scholl-fungal-nail-treatment-kit-69825011,Worked wonders! The bottle looks really tiny but it lasts the full 10 months needed for total treatment. I was sceptical to start with but its worked a treat!

I have used lots of super expensive but nothing special creams in my life to finally realise Im 99% paying for the marketing. Now I only buy products like this - natural simple ingredients at an honest price. And my skin has never been better!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,"I have also the shampoo line and I like very much the cream, I have a mixed type skin and the cream it absorbs well without making the skin shiny"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,I love the scent and it leaves my skin feeling lovely and soft. My favourite moisturiser. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,Sadly allergic to this
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,this product smells nice and softens your skin but isn't very effective as a moisturiser. maybe more suited to a younger skin. I have ended up using it as a body cream
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,I have been using Clinique super moisture for years this is far better. My skin feels hydrated as soon as I put it on and a beautiful smell. Will definitely be buying again.

Lovely moisturisers, feel luxe and smell great"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,Loving this face moisturiser and having tried numerous different ones recently this is definitely my favourite! On bottle no. 2 already and just bought the body one too!
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,"I tried this having read other reviews. I'm a bit on the fence. I love the organic ingredients and no nasties. It has an odd smell, not completely unpleasant but a mix of antiseptic tea tree and marshmallow sweetness. It also makes my skin feel a bit tight initially but no weird reaction from my sensitive skin. Have been using it morning and evening. Like the pump dispenser."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,If you plan on buying this I would suggest to instead go for the 'Sukin Hydrating Body Lotion'. The list of ingredients are word for word exactly the same however  is only £4/ 100mL whereas this is £6.39/ 100mL. Don't be conned by sneaky marketing.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,"Guilt-free, worry-free, effective facial moisturiser for a very reasonable price. Wish I'd discovered this product earlier it will definitely be my moisturiser of choice from now on."

https://www.ocado.com/products/sukin-natural-hydrating-facial-moisturiser-pump-277240011,I've been using this for a couple of months and to my surprise it's miles better than anything else I've used in ages. Very hydrating and even smooths out wrinkles!

https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,Im reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado. Im a big fan of the sure range and this one does not disappoint. I prefer the cream based deodorant but this roll on was fine for a change. Would recommend
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"This roll on applies very easily. The deodorant simply glides out of the roll on applicator and keeps you feeling fresh all day long. The scent is floral and quite powerful, meaning that you dont necessarily need a separate perfume."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,The applicator is good and dries reasonably quickly however I just was not keen on the smell.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"Its good, Im not the sweatiest person but I do like to keep smelling nice! Its not overpowering in scent and does the job."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,I was sent this to review... and Ill probably buy it again. It worked through a gym session followed by an afternoon in the office. Smells fresh and not too perfumed.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,I was given this to review. Its a larger than normal roll on and the product definitely glides out well. I didnt really notice a longer dry time compared to my usual roll ons. Unfortunately the smell just reminded me of bathroom cleaning products and I did find it quite strong.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"I was sent this to review.
I dont normally like any fragrance in my deodorant, but this is ok. Not too strong. Kept me feeling fresh after a gym work out."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"I really like the smell of this deodorant, and it works really well.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,This has a nice fresh smell to it and seems to last all day. Ill definitely use again.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,Fresh scent. I dont use spray deodorants so this is perfect for me.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,Very nice smell and I felt protected all day. As other reviews have stated it take a little while to dry which isnt a massive problem unless youre in a rush!
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"Great deodorant, definitely gives good protection. I used this at the gym and definitely felt it worked better than my usual deodorant.

I really like the scent and the texture. It does work all day and does it's job well. My only reason for dropping a star is that it takes between 5 and 10 minutes to dry which isn't great if you are in a rush. I will defintiely continue to use though.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"Lovely fresh scent, works really well. It is rather creamy so take a little time to dry off before you can dress."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"Yes it definitely protects from sweating, but I don't like the fact that it ruins my tops by leaving a heavy dry white mark on all of them. I will not be buying it again."

I have eco friendly salt or aloe sticks I use for normal use, but do like something with a bit more strength when out and active etc.  This has to be better environmentally than sprays, but it is quite sticky and the scent too strong.  Believe it works though!"

https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,I prefer spray

Wasnt keen on the smell, very old style deodorant smell like being back in the 70s when you only have one brand and scent. 
Taken a star off for the pong !"
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"I was sent this to review, and it is a perfectly decent roll-on deoderant, certainly keeping smells at bay all day.  I wouldn't know about longer, because I swim each morning!  The only downside for me is that it doesn't smell as good as Dove."
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,There was little to like about this product. The wait time for it to dry was ridiculously long. If you didnt wait long enough your armpits were left damp leaving patches on your clothes. On the occasions I did wait long enough this was a hard working antiperspirant but left my armpits feeling dry.
https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,this worked well in terms of protection against perspiration but left the pesky white powdery residue and took ages to dry. a little pricey but if it hadn't left the residue I probably would buy again.

https://www.ocado.com/products/sure-advanced-72h-protection-women-anti-perspirant-ultimate-fresh-roll-on-456231011,"There is obviously something wrong with our sense of smell - or maybe most other people have been indoctrinated. I was actually quite looking forward to this one, but - oh my days - what a pong! Opening it at first wasn't too bad. Application made me instantly regret it. Showed it to other half who recoiled in horror. 
We decided that it smelled like what the 1950s had defined that ""clean"" smelled like. A great shame, but it is a definite NO. 
It has been banished to outside the house. Maybe I should offer it to a teenager."

I put it on before dressing, did my make up and hair and it still wasnt dry after so I had to pat the excess off as didnt want it to end up in my clothes which ruins them.

I normally use the stick deodorants as I find roll ons take ages to dry which is the case with this one. Nice fragrance and still smelt fresh at end of the day which is a positive!

https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-for-blackhead-removal-494414011,i received this to review. It works perfectly as it claims. I use it regularly.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-for-blackhead-removal-494414011,Received free to review. They do exactly what they say on the box. But so do cheaper versions. But not many cheaper versions come with nose and face strips which is a bonus. Personally I wouldnt purchase it at full price.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-for-blackhead-removal-494414011,"I was offered to review this by Ocado. Actually my daughter tried them. They do remove a a fair amount of dirt and skin feels better for a while. However, there are other products available for a lot less that do a similar job. As a previous review stated, the results are, sadly, temporary."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-for-blackhead-removal-494414011,"This product is absolutely brilliant, so easy to use and extremely efficient.
Just follow the simple instructions and be amazed at the results.

Highly recommended."

https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-for-blackhead-removal-494414011,Given to review. I think it only works if you have really big blackheads otherwise it just peels off the epidermis making your nose temporarily cleaner
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-for-blackhead-removal-494414011,And really painful to take off. Having said that my son loves them.

https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-for-blackhead-removal-494414011,There is something very satisfying seeing normally unseen dirt being dragged out of the pores in your skin!

https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,This conditioner is meant to add volume to fine hair. I found that it didn't. I like a volume conditioner to give a bit of oomph. But it is a nice light textured conditioner and left my hair shiny if a little flyaway.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"Great conditioner that leaves my thick tangled hair soft and shiny. Packaging is lovely, product smells great, and it's good value. And vegan!"

https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"I love the fact that this 100% vegan but being so makes it quite pricey.  I found the scent rather underpowering as I love coconut scented products but found this difficult to pick up on.  However, it's a decent conditioner but as others have said, there are others just as good that are cheaper.  I would consider buying again at a cheaper price or if on offer."
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,Really love the texture and fragrance.

https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"This smells gorgeous and it does condition fairly well. I have thick hair which is damaged in places from colouring so I need intensive conditioners. This does leave it fairly soft. Its a big bottle but also expensive- I would purchase if discounted but I think there are better conditioners for less money. Having said that, if you want something environmentally friendly it would be a good purchase."
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,I received this free so I gave it to my wife as I have no hair. She said it was fine but wouldn't use it if it wasn't free. Hope it runs out soon as I really don't like the strong smell.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,This leaves your hair smelling very nice.  Not sure that my hair was left looking any more volumized afterwards but it did feel very soft.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,Lovely product. Left my hair feeling silky and smooth. This also has a beautiful smell to it. Would definitely buy again
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,I also found that I wasnt sure about the fragrance to start with but it grew on me. I actually thought the packaging seemed cheap for a more expensive conditioner but good to feel its a product doing its bit for the environment. Left my hair full but not feeling well conditioned.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"Lovely conditioner that smells great, and I love the fact that it leaves my hair smelling great for a couple of days after washing. A nice thick consistency and left my hair nice and soft. "

https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,Sent this to review. Average conditioner with lovely scent. Not convinced by its efficacy as a hair product.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,I found this conditioner to be okay but not great. I thought I would really like the smell of it but I dont particularly like it and I find that it really lingers which has put me off. It does make your hair feel lovely & soft which is why I have given it 4 stars. Agreed with other reviewers that bottle is difficult to squeeze.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"In received this to review from Ocado. Its not a product I would usually go for. Im not vegan (or even vegetarian) and usually buy from salons so this isnt something I would have ever considered. Im so glad I received it! Its a lovely consistency and a nice smell, not too overpowering. I was very surprised at how well this performed. It left my hair in much better condition that other more expensive ones dont even achieve. My hair is very fine and its hard to find a decent conditioner that isnt too heavy. My only slight quibble is the bottle, although a nice size and chunky design its not particularly squeezable and I can see it being a struggle to get all of the product out once I get down the bottle. May need to take the scissors to it as I cant bear wasting anything "
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,This isn't  cheap but it goes a long way  my hair is now very soft and shining the scent was nice not overpowering just  subtle and the actual product is very thick  so you need less and so it will last longer
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"Hair was soft after using this, like any good conditioner, but best of all, the smell was nice and not too overpowering. The price is high - like other conditioners that are free from the chemicals that you want to avoid"
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"I like this, smell is good and my hair feels soft but not quite as good as my usual coconut based conditioner, but sometimes hair needs to adapt to something new so will keep going with it. Not sure if I'll buy again, but I do like the eco credentails.  "
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,This product was a pleasant surprise - I am pretty ambivalent on the smell but the performance is good. It's thick enough to tame by hair - which is wavy with a tendancy to knot easily - but isn't so heavy that it flattens it completely. It's a nice balance between being effective and eco friendly! Even though it's slightly more expensive than my usual conditioner I would buy it again.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"A good conditioner without any of the artificial, chemically produced perfume of many on the market.  It seems to do a good job but is quite expensive at full price."
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"Nice, good quality product. Smells good and works well with my thin hair. Nice big bottle and not too expensive"
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,Excellent conditioner. Wife will buy it again even though its it a bit pricy. 2 for £10 makes it much more reasonable purchase.
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,"Like another reviewer I wasn't sure of the fragrance, but once on my hair it was lovely. It was a quality conditioner for my not too fine but wavy hair. It didn't weigh it down at all. I would buy again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,Nicely packaged product with lovely scent. Left hair feeling in as good a condition as with other more expensive conditioners. Good choice if you want a vegan product that is kinder to the planet than some other brands. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/love-beauty-planet-volume-bounty-conditioner-420864011,Smelt great and liked the packaging- looks good on bathroom shelf!

It made my hair softer I think, but i did not notice it any thicker looking or feeling whatsoever. And I was using the whole range, both shampoos, conditioner, mask, and this spray. The range is actually better that Genesis from kerastase, these pantene products won’t dry your hair! But no auper volume for my fine hair."

I always had thick hair but lately it’s not as thick as it was so I was keen to give this a try. 
I found it easy to use, and it smells lovely. I do think it made my hair appear thicker on day one but as I do not wash my hair every day by the second day it no longer had the same bounce. 
However the smell is so lovely I was happy to forgive and  I felt that if you wash your hair every day then this could be the product for you.
I will admit I never tried the blow drying method that it gives as an option on the packaging.
Day one results and the gorgeous smells mean I would happily recommend this product to those wanting to gain more volume."

https://www.ocado.com/products/pantene-pro-v-leave-in-hair-thickening-treatment-with-biotin-rose-water-542568011,"I am reviewing this product because I was sent a free sample from Ocado.  I have long hair that I thought might benefit from this product, so I was happy to give it a go.  However, I'm not sure it's really had the desired effect.  

To start with, I found the product really fiddly to use. You have to part your hair over your scalp and spray the product into it.  The amount that comes out with each spray feels really small - and it's a real faff to have to keep on doing this (5 times in total!).  You then let it dry naturally or with a hairdryer.  

On the plus side, it smelt really nice. And I think it did something to my hair - not necessarily thickening it - it actually looked even more unmanageable than it does usually!  And once I'd washed it again, it went back to 'normal' so I'm not sure the product is that long lasting.

I also found the description of this product annoying!  Maybe it's just me - but I think that any product claiming to 'create the look of 6500 more hair strands' is a bit much.  What does 6500 more hair strands look like, anyway?  And what if I thought it only looked like 5000 hair strands?  Could I get my money back??  Whoever thinks of these things?!?!?!"

There's no fine mist - it's badly distributed when you spray so some areas are overly done and others not enough.  As well as that the perfume is too strong."

I have quite thick, unruly curly hair and found this product was very thin, meaning I had to use lots to coat my hair. However I followed the instructions and hoped for the best.
Sadly this conditioner wasnt for me. My curls defeated this conditioner. Not only did I have to use a lot each time, but I was left looking a bit frizzy and even more unruly than usual.

I was quite eager to try this because I have used simple soap many times as I have eczema that flares up occasionally. The whole family tried this conditioner and we had varied comments about it. Personally my hair is quite fine and so I thought it was perfect as it softened my hair and didn’t make it feel limp or greasy.  My son liked it too. My husband on the other hand, Was not quite so impressed. He said that he felt that his hair was not moisturised enough. Having said that his hair is like a Brillo pad anyway so bear this in mind if buying this conditioner. The lesson being if your hair is like a Brillo pad you need something that is heavier but if you have normal to fine hair that has a tendency to be a little greasy then this is perfect. I love it."

I have very long hair, so I just put some in my hand to then work into my scalp/head then some more to work into the rest of my hair.  Used this way I used no more than I usually would.

https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"absolutely loved the results, highly recommended."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Woah. The stuff this got out my face haha. Will definitely buy again!
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"These pore strips are ok - you can use them with water then they go hard and peel them off. I found my pores seemed clearer, but I'm not sure it made much difference to my whiteheads and blackheads! Nice to buy if on offer."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"I've used on my husband and it works at treat!  Surprising to see what it removes! 

Didn't work as well on me then perhaps I didn't have much to remove."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"Received free to review. Although these did clear some blocked pores, I'm sure that I've used better ones in the past. Don't think I'd spend my money on these. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"My 20 year old daughter reviewed these and said that she felt her skin benefitted from using these and that they gave a really deep clean, reducing her blackheads."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,They will clear mildly clogged pores - but not deep down pore cleansing
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,I received these free for a review. I wouldn't normally use this sort of product but received free so gave it a go. They seemed to work fairly well.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,these do the job but are not really any better than cheaper alternatives.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"My teenage daughter has problems with breakouts on her nose and forehead.  We gave these a try.  I'm can't see that they are massively effective, but my daughter says she'd recommend them with 4 stars."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"Melaleuca alternifolia,one of the ingredients, is Tea Tree oil..another is Witch Hazel...probably cheaper to buy separately..and more effective! I prefer Salicylic Acid for real pore cleansing."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,I use these occasionally and I'm always pleased with the results. Satisfying. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"They are very good, used them since I was a teenager & now my teenager uses them!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,This product did partially clear my pores but didn't remove all the dirt.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"This does what it says on the box, easy application and removal with a nice smell."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"We tried this on two noses, it did the job on one but wasn't so effective at the other. Aloe Vera smell was nice, instructions were clear, packaging was easily removable. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Easy to use and left my skin clean and smooth.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Fascinating but gruesome- work well though 
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,There's nobody in my immediate family with a need for a product like this so I am going to offer it to my niece when I see her in the summer. Will try & report back!
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"They were easy to use, clear instructions and my nose felt very smooth afterwards but not a single pore was unblocked. I had such high hopes considering how expensive they are."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"I was sent this to review so gave it to someone with younger and less dry skin than I have.  They tell me that it removed quite a lot more pore dirt than washing alone.  They suggested a four out of five as they felt that, whilst effective, it wasn't as effective as they had hoped."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Either I have extremely clean pores or these do not work.  
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"I suspect these have varying results per user, my step daughter said it cleared hers completely, and it's definitely worked on mine, but not cleared completely."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,I was given this as a freebie to review. I have used similar products before but this one did not seem to work well and did not unclog pores on the strip. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,My wife loves it and we have bought again many times.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"These are brilliant, they've been around for ages and I've used them many times over the years. It's amazing to see what comes out of the pores- so satisfying! These are definitely the best of their kind on the market. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,these are very effective do a gross job well!!!
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,It didn't feel like a spa treat.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,I used to use these all the time as a teenager so it was a blast from the past to try them again. Delighted to report that they are still addictive - love inspecting the removed mask!!!
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,My daughter has been using these strips and said that they really do work! She is delighted at how easy they are to use and how effective they are. As my daughter has sensitive skin this really is a good find.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Excellent product.  These work really well on mature skin too  - don't think these are just for teenagers!
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,My daughter is using this and she loves it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Does what it says on the tin. Removes everything. Was pleasantly surprised. Really good stuff 
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,There's something rather compelling about seeing what these pull out.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,My daughter loves these.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,My daughter uses these and says they're brilliant although I think they're a bit expensive for the amount you get in a box. Best brought when on offer 
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Not great for sensitive skin. Ok when on offer but very expensive for only 6 strips otherwise. Regular exfoliation would probably give the same effect.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Easy to use but really didn't feel like my nose had perfectly clear pores afterwards. Not sure it'll be a regular addition to my skincare regime! 
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Use this after a bath and face mask once a month as a treat 
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"These are awful. They did not peel off my nose in one clean strip but in small clumps of fluff, with the exception of one little bit that came off like a strip and took the top layer of skin with it - leaving me with a very sore wound on the side of my nose. The rest are going straight in the bin."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,I thought I'd give it a try cause of the reviews and bought some of biore products. So far that is second product  I tested and I can say it is not better than other available for much less money.
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,Love these! You can actually see the dirt removed on the strip afterwards - very satisfying!
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,"I have used these for years and I think they really work, you can see the dirt on the strip.  I'm so glad Ocado now stock these."
https://www.ocado.com/products/biore-ultra-deep-cleansing-pore-strips-74474011,The product itself works well but the price is set far too high.

I find this body wash quite drying and it is adversely effecting my eczema.
Not a good one for my sensitive skin."

https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,This body wash smells good and is a big size so will last a long time. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Had this to review for my husband but was concerned as he has sensitive skin and usually sticks to un perfumed. He has used this often and is fine with it. He likes the nice thick consistency  making it easy to use without dropping all over the shower tray. Nice big bottle so should last well.
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,This smells so nice! I got this for my husband but Ive been using it too!
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,This has a nice neutral not too strong smell. Husband likes it
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"Sent to review, handed to the man of the house, and he says it works fine, but didn't notice any particular softening of the skin which you might have expected from a Dove product.  Nothing remarkable, but no complaints."
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Not too masculine. Good lather.  Like it!
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"Got this to review. Does the job and smells good, but its slightly drying. Texture is a bit like jelly if anyone was interested."

https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Good size product and not bad price. Better than the usual neon coloured mens body washes!
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Gets you clean. Doesnt have a strong fragrance.  A larger bottle means that its often better value.  Not sure in what way it is for men though - it would probably clean people of other genders just as effectively.
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"Good value for a large container, especially as you dont need much to make an effective lather. The aroma was fruity and invigorating and the consistency/texture was pleasant also. Great shower gel!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"This gel has quite a thick consistency which makes it easy to use and because its concentrated, a little goes a long way. It has a strong citrusy scent, but nothing too overpowering. It is a bit more expensive than some other gels but then its a 400ml bottle, and because its quite thick it will last a long time. In my opinion its a good all in one bottle wash, usable on body, hair and face....perfect for travel or the gym."
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Received as a freebie to review. My husband has used it and found it very refreshing and easy to use. I like the lemon scent too.
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Really nice actually - I was surprised.  Useful large size and good value for money.  Fresh smell.  I'll buy it again for sure.

https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"My husband says he did not like this at all, it was 'gloopy' and looked like snot! It smelled okay, but nothing special. He refused to use it again and went back to his old 'supermarket own brand'. 
I did find the texture weird myself, the lemon is okay but it's just lemon, I also found it a bit sticky and not so easy to wash off."
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"I was sent this, free, to review. Nice fresh scent and very refreshing to use. Found it to be a good quality shower gel/body wash. Easy to open and a good large sized recyclable bottle (400ml)."
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,I was given this to review by Ocado. Initially I considered it to be a little on the pricey side until I realised it was a 400ml bottle not the 250ml I am familiar with. My partner said it was nice to use but smelled a bit too much like lemon tart! I will try one of the other fragrances next time.
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,leaves skin feeling clean and fresh. Smell abit overpowering. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,My husband said this has a lovely fresh fragrance.  It lathers well and you dont need to use much so it will last a while.

https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,we got this to review for free.  It had a lovely fresh smell.  Nice consistency and would recommend it.  Although the price is a little on the steep side

Not sure what makes it sporty but Id get it again."
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"New fave shower gel. It feels very high quality, will definitely buy this again. Like the fact it is high viscosity so when you pop it on your head it doesnt run down into your eyes!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"Agree with others the smell is good, it also is quite a thick gel so it doesn't go everywhere. Shame is normally £3.50 as this expensive when compared with other brands."

You do get a good lather and don't have to use a lot of it quite thick consistency. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Reasonably priced and with a fresh fragrance. 
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,Like the fragrance and the fact you only need to use a relatively small amount. I sometimes suffer from dry skin so great to use a body wash that hydrates the skin and leaves you feeling refreshed. I would recommend giving this a try.
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011, my husband uses this after his run...he usually smells pretty bad but now this will change the situation.

https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,"A good product which is quite thick in consistency and a nice herby smell which is quite refreshing after a workout. Covers well, gives a low suds lather which is easy to remove in shower."
https://www.ocado.com/products/dove-men-care-sport-active-fresh-body-wash-457161011,This is a great smelling shower gel and a big bottle. It has a nice texture to use. Would probably not use regularly on my face as it did feel a little harsh for my face

https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-long-502627011,"I bought these as I couldn't get my usual Tena mini,  they are extremely comfortable, reliable and not at all bulky. The wrapping is a bit complicated and the wings are not all the way along but seem to work ok.  I would recommend, but at £2 for 10 and soon to go back up to £3 for 10, they are expensive."
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-long-502627011,I was hoping for an easy to use pad but was really frustrated that there were wings at the ends - not along the full length of the sides. The centre sticky part was stuck to the divided wings and it all stuck in the wrong places. Might work if  I cut off the wings? Sad because I have lichen sclerosis and wanted a thinner product.
https://www.ocado.com/products/glo-bamboo-incontinence-pads-for-sensitive-bladder-long-502627011,"Bought these for my mom as an alternative to the TENA pants she usually wears, and she absolutely loved them. Will be adding to our weekly shop from now on!"

It comes in both a fluoride and fluoride free option but I use the fluoride version to help with my sensitive teeth and for strengthening my enamel. Tastes fresh and minty (but not a horrible extra strong mint) and although its a natural toothpaste with no SLS, it froths well and gives good coverage with just a small amount. Never thought Id write a toothpaste review but this one is good!

https://www.ocado.com/products/nivea-fresh-blends-natural-apricot-mango-rice-milk-shower-body-wash-503738011,I’m reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado. The shower gel lathers well but I found the scent odd. Quite sweet-smelling but somehow musky and slightly synthetic at the same time. I did not like the residual smell on the body or in the air. I wouldn’t purchase this product.

On first using it struck me how thick this shower gel is, but this does seem to keep its moisturising properties which I like in a  cleansing product. Bizarrely though its so thick that if you don't squeeze out enough of it, it gets sucked back in !!!!

The smell on this is divine ...  so fruity, so uplifting... almost edible.

https://www.ocado.com/products/nivea-fresh-blends-natural-apricot-mango-rice-milk-shower-body-wash-503738011,"I am reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado. 
Firstly the scent, I like the scent, it was pleasant and not too strong.
In terms of ingredients and formula I noticed that it states it uses mostly natural ingredients, fine. I also noticed that it has a vegan formula but no where does it say it is cruelty free, I'm not sure I agree with a product using the word vegan if it is tested on animals...
Lastly I did not like the texture or packaging. The shower gel is very thick and if you squeeze the bottle too hard you get too much, if you don't squeeze it hard enough it get sucked back in when you release. The packaging also looks like a bottle of orange juice which I found odd. The shower gel itself felt quite slimy on my skin which I did not like.
I will use the rest but I will not buy again.

Chewable conjures up images of a jelly sweet as other brands make this is actually like a pez/energy tablet type thing. It does say tablet in the name so my bad but disappointed as not what i was hoping for. Flavour is fine but quite artificial and chalky plus they're huge which is fine as you have to chew them but a bit of a faff. You need TWO tablets for the recommended dose so this is actually really expensive for 15 days and you can get a much better complete mix by just buying the centrum basic multivitamin for £4.50, one a day for 30 days and has more diversity of vitamins. I'd take a vitamin hit for a delicious jelly sweet as it reminds me to take it but this isn't worth it. Can't recommend this product."

I like the strong minty taste. When I use with my electric toothbrush this is very thin paste and it dribble down my arm to elbow. Have switched to a manual toothbrush and it is much better.

Having said that, this one does have peroxide in it, in some kind of quantity. It's also perfectly nice as a toothpaste. However, it's got excessive packaging and an excessive price."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,am reviewing this product because I received a free sample from Ocado. This whole family liked this toothpaste as it has a nice fresh taste but find it expensive.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,"Im reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado.

This toothpaste does have a strong menthol flavour and is quite foamy in the mouth and bright blue in colour. For me none of that was a problem, and it did leave my mouth feeling clean & fresh. 

Not convinced there was a real difference in the whiteness and for that reason I wouldnt want to pay £12 for it. Perhaps with continued use, the whitening effect would improve, and when on offer at half price its worth a punt."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,I didn't mind the strong taste- I thought the clean was really thorough and was happy with the way my teeth felt afterwards.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,Nice strong flavour that leaves teeth feeling clean and fresh. It seems to do a pretty good job of removing some stains I am pleased so far with the results after a week.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,I liked this toothpaste the way it made my teeth and mouth feel altho I wasnt hot on the taste being a bit doffeeent initially! But I got used to it.

https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,I got sent this to review for ocado. Too much packaging and an average toothpaste.  tastes nice but couldnt see any visible differences.  seems to make more of a mess in the sink for some reason. wouldnt really recommend 
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,"I couldnt believe in this day and age how much extra plastic packaging came with this toothpaste. And on top of it the toothpaste tasted really weird, like eucalyptus, and I could see no difference whatsoever. I find using lush charcoal tooth tabs far superior."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,As a daily stain remover I thought this worked well. My teeth felt clean and polished after use. I wouldnt pay full price for it but at £6.00 its comparable with other similar brands I have used.

I wouldnt choose this over the usual product I use."
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,Not convinced it has made any difference and will not spend the extra money compared to normal toothpaste.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,Made absolutely no difference to the whiteness of my teeth after several weeks of using. A waste of money.
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,"Ive got through one tube and am going to give it one more tube while it is on offer (still too expensive though). And reason is because it actually contains, albeit in small amounts peroxide so should whiten eventually right?! To be utterly honest sofar not much difference snd fir the price and ingriedirnts i would of expected it to have. I think Im just a sucker to believe the claims. Will switch back to my usual soon and  save for whitening treatment at dentist rather than spend on toothpaste that isnt really worth the price. You might get good results Im certainly not getting more staining just not getting white teeth as I hoped for. Makes mouth feel clean though"
https://www.ocado.com/products/colgate-max-white-complete-toothpaste-500651011,"This toothpaste is made of high quality ingredients in my opinion as it doesn't irritate my sensitive teeth and gums.
It doest leave me with dry mouth as most whitening toothpastes do. And I noticed slight whitening effect too. 
The only criticism - box is made of thick plastic."

https://www.ocado.com/products/qv-moisturising-cream-500g-518789011,"Was asked to trial and review product.
Range of family members tried this,  with varying types of skin types.  All agreed it was very thick and left a type of waxy film on the surface.  maybe that's the point,  but it just felt a bit uncomfortable.  Didn't notice that it made any particular difference to very dry skin,  but (happily) family member with eczema not finding a problem at the moment, so unable to try specifically for that. So for that purpose wouldn't disregard it as a recommendation to others,  but wouldn't for management of more straightforward dry skin. "

https://www.ocado.com/products/qv-moisturising-cream-500g-518789011,Was sent this to review by Ocado. Hubby suffers badly with dry skin and is prone to itchy eczema patches. Looking at the tub and ingredients we thought it might be as thick and unpleasant as Cetraben but it is thinner so easier to apply and sinks in much better.

At first I thought it would be similar to many other similar products I have used for dry skin but this cream is different, I would say more luxurious. It actually feels like light wool on the skin and sinks in without any greasiness or unpleasant smell.
The skin felt and looked much healthier and the effect on sensitive, dry patches was incredible.
Worth a try if you have dry skin or just want to keep skin healthy."

It's easy to mix, with a pleasantly chocolatey, slightly creamy, texture.  It's low sugar, but tastes very sweet due to the added sweeteners.  It's a bit like a creamy, cold, version of a hot chocolate drink.  
I'm not doing keto, so can't comment on its value in that regard, but, given its relatively clean ingredients list, it could make a good aid for either a weight loss diet or, alternatively, could be an easily consumed source of extra calories for someone not feeling much up to eating.  A portion is a modest 200 ml once mixed, and has 200 calories, so no massive volumes to get through.  The manufacturer suggests shaking it up in a tub, but I just used a fork to quickly whip it together in a glass, which worked well.  Personally, I could have done with less sweeteners, but otherwise pretty good."

https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,This does 'Work'. Lovely scent and nicely relaxing at bedtime.
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,Lace o or not Im on my second bottle despite the price. Been an anxious sleeper (#lockdown) and feel this calms me to sleep.
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"I was skeptical and I don’t like lavender, so despite being told to try this for my inability to fall asleep and constant waking throughout the night, I ignored the advice, especially when I saw the small bottle and the price tag in JL!
As it happens I received a full size body cream  in a My JL goodie bag and I tried it, I was pleasantly surprised by how well I slept when using it. 
I don’t like lotions, fussy I know, So, I decided to try a travel size pillow spray..... 
well, night one I was out like a light. 
Night 2, same thing, went without for a night and regretted it.
£19.50 and a bottle lasts me a couple of months, is it worth it? 
Absolutely! 
Would I recommend it- absolutely!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"Even after several sprays on the pillow, the smell vanishes in seconds. Im not sure I get the point."
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"I was dubious about buying this at the cost - wondering if I was wasting my money.  I am a long time poor sleeper post menopause. I have tried other products that work to a degree or for a while but still I was not getting great sleep.  However, I tried this spray on my pillow last night. I went to sleep quickly and stayed asleep for a full 8 hours until the alarm went off! Fabulous! It might have been a fluke but if I get a few more good nights then the cost at nearly £20 will be worth it. (It is a decent size bottle so hopefully will last some time)"
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"this really does work.  I am a terribly light sleeper and have always found it difficult to quickly get to sleep,,,until I was gifted this spray.  All my favourite scents.  Lavender and vetiver fantastic,  No fabric staining."
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"I really have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep, but with this, I slept within minutes of getting into bed and stayed asleep all night, bar when my LO woke me, but then went back to sleep afterwards, when usually I would lie awake!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,This is the only thing that stops me waking up multiple times through the night. If I forget to use it then I am awake every couple of hours so this has really helped.
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"I was recommended this when I was struggling to sleep during my 2nd pregnancy, I doubted it would help but gave it a go, my husband and I have never slept so well! Very pleasantly surprised. Cant recommend enough!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"Amazing smell, relaxing and like being at a spa"
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"This is by far the best Pillow Spray on the market, having tried and tested many I always come back to This Works, it is worth every penny."
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,I bought this after reading previous reviews. Smell very nice but didnt help us sleep at all.
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"I've had rather chronic insomnia for sometime and although this doesn't always work for me, neither do some prescription meds either. 
I received this and the temple roll on as a freebie in a hotel I stayed in and I can honestly say that for the most part, this stuff really does work. I feel a lot more relaxed a lot quicker and find that I doze off quicker than before. 
If you have problems sleeping or relaxing at bedtime, then give this a shot- I'm certain it'll help. 
Minus 1 star for being so expensive. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,This Works!  I was bought this spray by my wife as I often have issues sleeping and switching off before bed.  A few sprays of this before I get into bed and i'm out like a light.  I use with deep sleep stress less when I need some extra unwinding too.
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"I too agree with the two reviews.  It is a lovely clean and gentle scent, but very expensive.  I've tried making my own as one of the reviewers noted, never smells quite as nice as this product.  I will buy again as Christmas treat."
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,It smells beautiful but I agree with the other reviewer - the smell doesn't linger.
https://www.ocado.com/products/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray-76553011,"The spray is lovely, smells nice and relaxing and not too strong. However it does go away very quickly so I can see the bottle being finished quite soon and at this price, it is just not worth it. I don't think I will use it again, instead I might mix my own blend at a fraction of the price."
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,It melts nicely on a toast.
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Not great as a butter replacement, have ended up using it for cooking. It’s fine for that, but not worth the cost. If you’re looking for a vegan butter substitute on Ocado, Flora Buttery is a better bet."
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,I am trying to move away from palm oil and tried this as a trex replacement in vegan buttercream and it worked beautifully. I keep it in the fridge so perhaps the people experiencing a fishy flavour have some rancid oil? I need to try it on toast next to find out if it is going to work as a margarine replacement.
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"I'm cutting out dairy as an experiment and was concerned about how much I'd miss butter, but it's been great - because of this stuff! Great taste and consistency, and works on anything you'd normally put butter on. Just add a little salt and you're sorted. It is pricey, but the jar has lasted me over a month so far."
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,Perfect alternative to butter with no nasties added. It needs to be kept in the fridge.
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Was expecting a coconut flavour, but just smells of cheap oil.  It also separated at a warm room temperature.  Really disappointed I spend so much money on something that went in the bin."
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,Although this contains no actual fish oil it smells and tastes remarkably fishy. Made me gag when smeared over my morning toast with jam *shudder*
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"So glad. I discovered Tiana. Lovely on toast. Its vegan, free of all the bad stuff including palm oil. Whats not to like?"
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,I took a risk buying this because several reviewers said it smelled and tasted of fish. I really want vegan brandy butter on my Xmas pudding so I decided I buy some anyway. I am thrilled that it doesnt smell or taste of fish and instead has a lovely flavour and is a great butter replacement.
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,Fantastic product instead of butter
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,I love the taste and will definitely order this again
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"This is a very nice tasting spread which I loved. Spread on bread is simply delicious. Plus, it has the benefit of Omega 3 added which is believed to be very good for health. Highly recommended"
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Very sadly, I have to agree with the other reviewers with regards to the fishy taste of this product. I just can not understand why this has got such good reviews. I guess that something must have changed in the way the product is made very recently as so many people are reporting the same problem. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"This used to be amazing, but lately tastes fishy and disgusting..... so sad that I now have to source another vegan spread to my liking"
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Although it does not contain any fish, all I can taste is fish. I find it very unpleasant and inedible."
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Is it meant to smell and taste like fish? Maybe it's mouldy but either way it's revolting, refund requested."
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"If this was sold as a cooking fat, it would be perfectly acceptable. I love the concept of a spread made without palm oil and only natural oils, but sadly it's really not very nice. It's too hard at fridge temperature, and too oily at room temperature, and it tastes like cooking oil. I'd rather drizzle olive oil on my toast, and use this for cooking with."
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Food intolerances and other products have made me ill, somehow this taste like unsalted butter. After years i finally have something to put on a jacket potato, if you have tried everything else including spreads full of chemicals and emulsifiers, to get a good taste seriously give this a go. I do not like coconut oil, flaxseed or olive oil, however the three together in this taste like butter, i do not know how they have done it, so so happy!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,This spread really does taste similar to butter.  Most dairy free spreads taste artificial and bland but this has a creamy texture (similar to butter) and a delicious taste.   I would definitely recommend this to vegans and those trying to reduce the amount of dairy foods in their diet.
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Tried this on strength of reviews and when on offer. As a vegan for 22 years I'm not sure I remember the taste of butter but I know it was great and that most vegan margarines are pretty tasteless. This is much tastier on toast, plus the omega 3 is a bonus. Very solid once in fridge so needs to be left out to be spreadable or will melt and spread when in contact with hot food. It's a small jar so will be saved for treats and bought when discounted!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"I don't often write these reviews but I have gone dairy free and really disliked the vegan spreads on the market. I was having coconut oil on toast with some sea salt, but now I have tried this (with sea salt) I am hooked. It has the same consistency as butter when melted on toast and is nicer in a way as it doesn't have the aftertaste of butter "
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,"Ok, so perhaps this is a great product for vegans and I can understand why but I have to absolutely disagree that this is a tasty alternative to dairy butter. As a vegetarian, I enjoy a wide variety of foods from health shops and some of these are vegan but this really isn't one for me. I am very disappointed, as I am trying to reduce my dairy intake and was hoping this would help. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,I love this but it doesn't last as long as a pack of president unsalted butter for example and is three times the price. Does it have to cost so much?
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,Healthy alternative to butter and tastes amazing! 
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,I have only been dairy free for 2 months so am painfully aware (and still remember) how good butter tastes... This is an amazing alternative to creamy butter - I think it actually tastes better! So much better than using vegetable oil spreads - health and taste wise.
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,I've been vegan for over 20 years so can't remember what butter tastes like - but this tastes really delicious and has nothing in it apart from healthy oils
https://www.ocado.com/products/tiana-organic-omega-3-coconut-spreadable-butter-261477011,Not sure with the taste but I'm pretty sure of the good benefits that I can get. I use this for my toddler's toast and he loves it! Omega 3 is a bonus.
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-osteocare-liquid-354370011,"A very sweet, viscous liquid.  Im sure its calcium/vit D content is excellent, but personally its so sweet its a bit unpleasant."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-osteocare-liquid-354370011,Recommended by paediatric dietician at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital.  My extremely fussy toddler is happy to take this. Thank you for stocking this Ocado.
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-osteocare-liquid-354370011,"I really like this, it is quite sweet but aside from that, I started taking this following both of my pregnancies as I could feel that my calcium was low (my teeth felt almost porous) and I have felt much better since and noticed renewed strength to my teeth and bones."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-osteocare-liquid-354370011,"I'm so happy that Ocado is now stocking this!  I take this daily and prefer it to the tablet version, as being liquid it is easy to take and gentle on the stomach.  It has a pleasant taste, and also has added vitamin D, which we are now being recommended to consider taking."

https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,"Both my sons love them. I personally don't like the smell, but omega 3 is supposed to smell like this. "
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,"My children ask for these, and I sometimes eat one too. Happy these are vegetarian."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,Like sushi rotting in a diaper
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,"Great that they’re suitable for vegetarians, more affordable than other brands, and adults can take them too. But why do they taste and smell plasticy and fishy, with a hint of weird orange? I have to chase them down with food to get rid of the bad taste, otherwise they make me feel a bit sick."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,Our kids are excited to have these in the morning. When you open the lid they do smell of algae but weve never made a fuss over it and they have never mentioned it.
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,"I don't quite understand the previous reviews - maybe there's been a bad batch at Ocado. I've been giving these on and off to my 3 and 5 years olds for a while and they never complain. My complaint is that the 2 jellies per day are recommended, which means I'd need 4 packs a month for my two, and that seems very expensive for the amount of Omega 3 they'd get."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,"My son desperately wanted to like these (sweets), edged it closer and closer to his mouth, but couldnt bare to put them in his mouth. THEY STINK like a dead fish!!!"
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,"I wasn't surprised that neither of my kids would eat these, they even smell disgusting! I think if you're expecting a child to eat something remotely disguised as a sweet you need to consider eliminating the smell of fish! Please redesign these..."
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,Agree with previous reviewer. These taste awful. Son refused to eat them.
https://www.ocado.com/products/vitabiotics-wellkid-peppa-pig-omega-3-490012011,Had to throw these away. My daughter refused to eat them - realised why once I tasted them. They taste of fish.
