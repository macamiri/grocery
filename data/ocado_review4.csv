https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,I noticed that this product is no longer in the Greek style range. The ingredients are not the same as before. The main difference is that the cream is replaced by starch. This is very disappointing.  This new version is thin and lacks the creamy texture.,NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,The yogurt is amazingly rich and creamy and the vanilla flavour is is just the right level of sweetness whilst tasting naturally good.

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"This is lovely, course it is, full fat creamy and delicious but honestly the low fat version was so much nicer but I cant find it anywhere anymore. Very sad. Rachels yoghurt please consider bringing back as I wont eat this nearly as much as so much more fattening. Thanks",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"I used to go by price with yogurt, until I found Rachels. I love the yogurt and the vanilla can not be beat. Really creamy and a genuine vanilla taste.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Sadly with the change in packaging and recipe, what was our favourite vanilla yoghurt has been ruined. It now tastes so artificial. I will not be buying again :(",NA

what a shame as it was our favourite vanilla yoghurt",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,I fully agree with the previous two!,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Rachels has recently undergone a rebrand and seem to have a new recipe, no doubt worried about new creamy vanilla competitiors. It's a pity - the new recipe certainly tastes nice but that's because they've added  whole load of extra stuff to it, like rice starch and pectin. Pity, it used to be lovely and natural, but now they've thickened it with additives and it's for the worse. After nearly 20 years of being a loyal customer I shall not be buying it anymore. What a shame they chased a short term buck for a lower quality product.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,This has been a favourite of mine for ages but the recipe seems to have changed for the worse,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"This tasted just right for us, real vanilla used and comes through perfectly. Its really light as well and doesnt have the high sugar content that the low fat or fat free products tend to. Would recommend highly",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Shocked at how much sugar is in this, I know other brands are far worse. I now dilute it  1/2 and 1/3 with full fat natural yogurt and my children havent noticed. Please bring back full fat yogurt with less sugar. The low fat high sugar products are not creating healthy options. Its more satisfying or put the fat back in. Thank you for making them organic.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Lovely yoghurt that keeps for ages.
Vanilla pod seeds give a delicious natural flavour.
We have ours with strawberries and chocolate granola!",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"No yucky sweetners the best bonus! Thought this quite thick and tasty for low fat yogurt.  Not over overpoweringly sweet or vanillary.  Subtle flavour so nice to with stuff rather than plain yogurt.
Rachel's please continue to provide subtle sweetness without sweetners, 'natural' or not... but continue to work on packaging that can all be biodegradable or recycled!",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Would prefer a little thicker but really nice taste,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"We got this free to try it. I have seen the comments about it being thin and one referred to the unpleasant vanilla taste. It is in no way thin and has a good, full taste of vanilla - if you like the flavour of real vanilla you'll love this. It is a little sweet, but that makes it perfect for a dessert. It is on our regular shopping list now and the current offer of two for £2.00 makes it even better.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Tasted fine but my household definitely prefer fruity yoghurts so won't buy again,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,I like the vanilla flavour which is subtle. Maybe a little too subtle that it's tempting to add a bit of honey to make it a bit sweeter....but I guess it wouldn't be low fat anymore if it had more sugar. Overall I'd recommend.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Delicious and surprisingly rich for a low fat alternative. Great with granola.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Nice low fat yoghurt which didn't taste low fat. Bit sweet but very nice,NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Really enjoyed this. It is very sweet, but its very tasty. In fact the kids will wolf it down as soon as they see it in the fridge. I will be buying this weekly instead of kids yoghurts.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,I adored this. It didn't taste or feel like low fat. Very posh. I could imagine this as a substitute for cream over a desert because it wasn't sour like other yoghurts. Get some!,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,I prefer my yogurt a bit less sweet but having said that it was deliciously creamy with a lovely vanilla flavour. I still prefer Tims Dairy though. ,NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Thin texture, unpleasant vanilla flavour and didn't come with a resealable plastic top so I had to put foil on it in the fridge.

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Nice creamy yoghurt but a little too sweet for me so will stick with plain Greek,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,really loved the flavour and consistency of these yoghurts - you have to try the coconut one!  Feels like a nice treat to have for dessert rather than just being a 'boring' yoghurt,NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"My daughter said she liked this, but proceeded to eat no more of it. I can see her point of view; the taste is best described as 'different'. I'd not choose to eat it again, but then I prefer my yoghurts a bit more tart.",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Our whole family enjoys eating this yogurt.  I like it on top of muesli with a splash of milk added. My daughter likes it to top strawberries for desert and I've caught my partner eating it straight from the pot.
It's a fairly thin texture which you could just about pour over stuff and has a fairly robust vanilla flavour which we all enjoyed.  Would buy this again.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"Received free to review, this is our regular brand and this didn't disappoint. Lovely with fresh fruit, and always on offer! Would definitely recommend this yogurt. ",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,This wasn't creamy/thick enough for me as a yoghurt. The vanilla flavour was nice but reminded me of eating custard! Not what you really want for first thing in the morning. Although this could be used as an alternative to custard on cakes and desserts. ,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Not loved by everyone in the household  but tasted good. Just the texture.,NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"This had quite a strong vanilla taste which I liked but was a little sweet for me, and a bit runny as others have observed.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Agree with other reviewers.  This reminds me of custard and is far too runny- completely unsuitable for having with morning muesli.  Taste was however acceptable.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,I like vanilla custard and vanilla ice cream but this yoghurt didn't do it for me. I found it was a strange texture and a bit too runny and I didn't enjoy it at all.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,This is very creamy and has a strong vanilla flavour.  Love that it is organic and if you like custard - you will like this.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,The yoghurt seemed thick and creamy despite the fact that it is low fat and it tasted nice too! Recommended.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,Lovely light tasting yoghurt but was a little on the runny side for me. I like thick yogurt... This isn't thick,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"I got this as a freebie to review. On the plus side it's organic so good for health, animals and the environment.  Also it has a short list of ingredients and no nasties. Unfortunately as most low fat yoghurts there is a lot of added sugar to compensate for the lack of fat. I'd rather go with full fat and no sugar option. To sum up, this would be an occasional treat but not my daily yoghurt.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"I had this to try from Ocado - the taste is lovely but I had forgotten that, having tried Rachel's yogurts before, I always find the texture really weird and runny which completely puts me off!",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"This has the consistency of runny cream, it felt like I was eating it too I am sorry to say.  There was a vanilla flavour but there was also an odd residual taste.   This will not go in my basket again sadly.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,I tried this and was pleasantly surprised by the taste. Normally when a yogurt says 'vanilla' I expect a mere hint of the stuff but not in this. If you know how fresh vanilla pod seeds taste then that is the taste you get from this. The yogurt was a nice thick consistency and not too runny and I had it over fresh strawberries and cherries which it went very well with.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/rachel-s-organic-luscious-vanilla-yoghurt-19317011,"This was a gift with my shopping. Found it runny and slimy, far too sweet,with an artificial vanilla taste.Would not purchase.",NA

Go for a non milky drink - and use your own fresh milk, Heat it ion a microwave if you want a hot milky coffee.

It is very smooth with a nutty oaty flavour and the high coffee content is hidden away in the chocolate. It needs a very very very good shake as it naturally settles very thickly in the bottom of the bottle.

I roasted them with dried herbs, olive oil and lemon juice over a bed of potatoes and carrot chunks at 180 for about 45 minutes. They were still quite moist, a good amount of the connective tissue had melted making it easy for me to pull the meat off the bone for serving, and, though the meat was a bit underflavored compared to what I'm used to, the potatoes which had cooked in the fat were still really good. I prefer free-range both from a taste and welfare stand point, but these are good, especially for the price.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/ocado-british-chicken-drumsticks-56965011,Im reviewing this product because I got a free sample from Ocado. The meat was not nice as it was chewy and difficult to separate from the bone. We brought these the other week and they were the same then. I thought maybe it was just a bad batch but since having them again they are obviously all the same. Not enjoyable at all so I definitely would not buy them again.,NA

The fruit layer was not too sweet and the tangy- ness of the mango and passion fruit came through.

https://www.ocado.com/products/karaway-bakery-sweet-poppy-brioche-loaf-480120011,"First of all, this needs to be warmed to be appreciated. When cold, it's a tad dry but is still delicious even then. I've never tasted this flavour before. The poppyseeds have a unique taste, close to cinnamon but more mild. Where some brioche has a custard running throughout, this one is more similar to a cinnamon roll filling, but with poppyseeds. It's moist and squidgy and so yummy. It's also visually beautiful. If you had a fancy brunch, this would impress. I bought it for a weekend family treat, got it on Wednesday and managed to eat half of it for my lunches before the weekend came around, I couldn't stop  myself. I bought it on sale, but am buying it again at full price. Worth it! I have an artisanal bakery that sells much smaller loaves for 3.75 so, 4.55 for this is ok for a nice treat. Also, it would cost more in time (hours at least!) and ingredients if I had to make myself; brioche takes like 10 eggs and I pay around 3.50 for nice eggs anyway. It is so lovely, try it.

https://www.ocado.com/products/karaway-bakery-sweet-poppy-brioche-loaf-480120011,Karaway Bakery is one of the reasons for buying from Ocado. I have bought this bread for over a year now and I love it. It is a large brioche loaf and lasts we'll over many days. I sometimes make it last by freezing half and it has never affected the quality. I don't agree with the comments about sweetness/too much sugar. I hardly have any sugar in my diet but I love this loaf as a treat. It is clearly described as a Sweet Loaf. It really is something special. It has swirls of a unique poppy seed paste and has such a lovely flavour and texture. At Christmas it often has beautifully thin icing and white stars drizzled over the top as a seasonal treat. Great product.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/karaway-bakery-sweet-poppy-brioche-loaf-480120011,"This is nothing like a good brioche should be, and worse still it is absolutely loaded with the equivalent of approx 14 teaspoons worth of sugar.  The bread itself is dryish and dense, not light like brioche should be.  The poppy paste that is all-too-liberally laced throughout the whole loaf is so cloying and sickly-sweet I could only manage two bites before binning the whole thing.  I would suggest you check out the sugar content of other loaves from this bakery too- their Borodinsky for example has an astonishing 16tsps of sugar- about 1tsp sugar in every slice!",NA

But undeterred I sliced off a piece. The bread itself is not bad, quite a pleasant airy texture. However,as others have said, the poppy seed filling is so very very sweet and  doesn't quite balance with the flavour of the bread.

The flavour of the quiche is overwhelmingly oniony, it's all you can taste. It even overpowers the smoked bacon.. And yet, even the strong onion flavour cannot mask that this quiche is utterly flavourless. Quite a feat. 

I was also disappointed that the quiche was packaged on a plastic tray, not in a metal tin, which would go straight in the oven. Odd.

I've been ordered this bean for around a year now. Usually the beans I received was roasted 3-4 weeks ago which I find perfect to use it immediately for an espresso.

I like this revelation blend. As a former barista I make myself two to three cups of flatwhite or cappuccino everyday. This blend is NOT the most flavoursome bean on the market (but definitely the best on Ocado or Waitrose). But it is consistent and easy to use.

Heres why:

This Naan is the best you can buy from a supermarket. Thats true. But, you can elevate it to heights beyond with a closely guarded trick of the restaurant trade.

Heres how:

Prepare the naan as instructed, 4/5 minutes in the oven. Meanwhile, half-melt some butter (a good chunk) in the microwave in a small bowl. Chop a handful of coriander and grab some garlic paste, about 2 teaspoons (fresh garlic finely minced will also work but paste would be better... its sold on Ocado) and mix it all up in the bowl with the butter.

Finally, as the Naan comes out, slather with the buttery, garlicky, coriander-y mixture.

Done. Its better than most takeaway naans.

Like others this came as a substitute for the M&S best ever Steak Pie. First thought was to refuse the substitution, but I didn't, my mistake. It is relatively thin but quite heavy, as a result there is far too much pastry on the bottom and edges. It tastes really good but it is the wrong shape. Fortunately there are just two of us, so we cut off the edges and didn't touch the base pastry layer. Jon Thorner claim they are award winners, my guess is that it wasn't for this pie.

https://www.ocado.com/products/jon-thorner-s-steak-ale-family-pie-94625011,"I have purchased this many many times and it is much loved in our household....... needless to say we were as upset as many of the recent reviewers when our latest purchase had completely changed.  I contacted Ocado with feedback but also emailed the Manufacturer directly to express my disappointment.

This is the response I received

Sometimes companies like ourselves make decisions that, in hindsight, we wish we had never made. This is one of those times. Our original  steak and ale pie is a nationally acclaimed award winning pie with accolades from The Smithfield awards, The National Pie awards, Great Taste Awards and Best in The West Awards. We recently took the decision to change our recipe to include mushrooms, this has proved to be a great mistake. To this end, with immediate effect, we are reverting back to our traditional recipe. Our reputation means everything to us and hopefully you will appreciate we have taken your negative review as a clear sign that we should never have changed the recipe, we can only apologise profusely and hope that are reassured that your comments are taken seriously, and that you will give us a second chance.

Hats off to them for taking on board customer feedback, here's to many more great pies!",NA

Well, it can happen and Jon Thorner's chefs have done this to their Steak and  Ale pie.

This was a work of art, a pie so wonderful as to be the finest pie I had tasted. But now, look at the ingredients' change and all is revealed. This is wanton vandalism on an Epicurean scale. It is beyond forgiveness. What was a masterpiece amongst pies is now a mouldy tasting lump of expensive tat. Buy a Walls sausage roll, it is cheaper and better.",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/purition-cocoa-wholefood-nutrition-powder-486754011,"I eat a Keto diet.  

This is pretty Keto friendly, I wanted something sweet and chocolatey.  This is not really what I was looking for.  

However, it has its own special flavour which I have grown to love.  I have this with almond milk (eugh) and it makes the almond milk almost tasty!  I did end up adding cream to it too! 

If you are expecting this to taste like a melted bar of galaxy you are going to be very disappointed, however, its Keto and you cannot expect miracles.  The longer I eat Keto the less sugar cravings I get and things don't need to be so sweet.  

If you are keto then give it a go, not just one, try it a few times with some keto friendly additions to it and you might just uncover a little gem.",NA

Beyond that, there were TONS of pin feathers in the skin. Every now and then in skin-on chicken you have the odd few pin feathers or hairs, but this was really shocking.

My one complaint is the size of this thing. I ordered a medium so expected around 1.8 kg as I wanted a slightly smaller one this week. I got a 2.318 kg one...my last large one was 2.4 so yeah, not much difference...glad it was on offer!

I put them out when we had guests who didn't follow a gluten or dairy free diet, without mentioning that they were 'free from'.

So Mrs Crimble's Free From Large Coconut Macaroons...

The pros ~ these look more or less like home made macaroons, and have a coconut aroma.  Their texture is chewy and moist and they have a natural coconut flavour.   While they are not cheap, they are better value than many 'free from' type snacks and treats.

The cons ~ these macaroons are incredibly sweet, containing around 50% sugar by weight!

Ive eaten every flavour in every size.  Im probably as close as you are going to get to a Tortuga Rum Cake Ambassador this side of the Atlantic...

Its a rich sponge cake soaked in premium rum, and I do mean *soaked*.  You only need to serve small slices of this!  Its vacuum sealed and that means if its unopened itll last a good year in the cupboard or indefinitely if kept in the fridge or freezer.  Even if youve got it opened and its dried out a bit just add some good Caribbean rum to refresh it!  (I use Sailor Jerrys on mine).

This is the basic 16oz cake at a pretty good price.  Its better than the typical resale price you find in the shops in the US, and about half the price of buying it direct.  That said, it isnt cheap and isnt trying to be - its a premium specialty product.

The halloumi is lovely and is all gooey when heated, and the sauce is simply excellent, with a real depth of flavour that causes the aroma to make my kitchen smell as if something really special has been cooking in it! Plenty of oomph from the red peppers. I’ve cooked them under the grill, which works well. The skewers become very hot and I can’t really see the point of the skewers as they just fall out of the gooey cheese once it’s cooked anyway. They are also super quick to cook if you put them in a George Foreman grill or similar, taking literally just a few minutes - make sure you put a tray underneath it to catch the oily drips and sauce though! In short, really impressed with these as they are delicious and there are so many ways you could serve them. I’ll be buying them again and look forward to trying the pesto ones.",NA

As others have remarked the top is a thicker really rich creamy layer, not as rich as the crust that forms on clotted cream but along those lines.  I love that bit! The rest is creamy & just the right texture. 
The caramel is perfect for me. Not too light in flavour and not so dark that it has begun to taste at all bitter. 
The only problem? They are really expensive for two, so will be kept as a treat. Probably just as well.....",NA

They only had the one ingredient...the corn,a nd now they've got stabalisers and all sorts. Not as great as before. They used to be soft and easy to cook, now these are dry and pretty tasteless. I knew that buying them though as I have purchased them before in speciality shops. I am glad to see Ocado stock them as they are exactly what you want for migas, enchiladas or tacos. More than adequate than the corn tortillas old el paso sells. With that said if you're in london try Mestizo market, they are the best corn tortillas outside Mexico.

We often eat flour tortillas but rarely corn. These smelt really unpleasant out of the packet but most of the smell dissipated in cooking. Warmed in a dry pan and they softened nicely, but didnt really like the taste.

I am bang on the target market for this product. I chose to cut out alcohol from my diet about 19 months ago but still enjoy a grown up drink as a treat to help me relax on an evening. I rely heavily on alcohol free lagers but miss the cocktail/punch/mixer drinks especially in hot weather. This is the second of this brand I've tried and I really like it. The flavour is just as titled - cucumber and rosemary. I don't know what yuzu is - haha! It reminds me of Hendricks, without the gin bite, with sliced cucumber in it. served over ice with a slice of lemon it's a tasty but light punch and with it being low in calories and sugar is a great evening treat.

I was a little bit disappointed. It has a pleasant mid range flavour. If that's what you're looking for, I'm sure you'll love this cheese as it is a good quality product and very pleasant. It just seemed to us to be neither one thing nor the other. We'll stick with mild or strong. ",NA

It is a mild to medium cheddar with a good, but not overly strong taste, so it is exactly what you would expect for its title. It is sold at an excellent price point too making it very good value for money. I tend to purchase strong mature cheddar, so it wouldn't be my first choice, but it is an excellent option for anyone who likes medium cheddar, and is especially good value for families.
