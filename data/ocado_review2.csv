Big thumbs up all round! Its very moist and chocolatey, the fudge gives it added oomph without being over-powering. You dont need a huge wedge of this cake either as its so rich and filling. Felt like a really naughty treat. 

Friend says her husband doesnt normally like chocolate cake but he devoured this one! 

I was a bit put off by the best before date being two days after delivery but I guess thats why it might have been in the flash sale  however, my daughter and I have still been indulging in this cake past that date and its still absolutely lovely. 

I probably wouldnt buy this again at full price as a naughty treat for my daughter and I as it takes a while for us to eat it but DEFINITELY if I have friends coming over - I can imagine this cake would be a big hit for any upcoming festive parties.

They do require frying in very hot oil which needs to be deep enough to completely submerge the poppadom as it expands. If they don't crackle and expand dramatically then the oil isn't hot enough.

https://www.ocado.com/products/ruby-plain-madras-poppadums-43116011,"I have been buying these for years, and always fry them. I recently tried microwaving after reading all the reviews. The result? Not too bad. But they don't expand much, and lack flavour. And the smell from the microwave is appalling. Lots of reviews say quite good but not like restaurant pops. Well, all I can say is, I agree. But fry them, and they are EXACTLY like restaurant pops! They expand to the size of a dinner plate, and taste fabulous. I use a 500ml bottle of ground nut oil in a largish frying pan, so the oil is about 2cm deep. Get it hot. If it isn't hot enough, the pops don't cook quickly, and end up very oily. When the oil is hot enough, a small test piece dropped in will bubble and expand immediately. When ready, slide a pop in and using tongs swirl it gently so it all gets submerged. After a couple of seconds it will have expanded to fill the pan. Turn it over to ensure any missed bits around the edge get done, and after another couple of seconds lift out and stand on edge on some kitchen paper. After a few minutes they will be beautifully crisp and completely dry. If they stay oily, your oil is not hot enough. If they are colouring much, you are leaving them in too long. When the oil has cooled, pour it back in the bottle, label it and use it next time you want them, topping up a little. It lasts quite a few cycles before it needs throwing away.

The strongest aroma comes from the lemon, while the predominant flavours are lemon and camomile. The tulsi delivers a hint of aniseed. I perceived a background punchiness and warmth, similar to teas containing licorice or ginger. Overall, the taste is quite subtle and pleasant to drink. Although I can’t say I’ve noticed extra clarity – inner or otherwise - I’ll be adding this to my (extensive!) range of teas - I do like a variety to select from.

I find teabags in envelopes very handy, as (a) they’re easier to store and stay fresh once a box is open in the limited space in my kitchen cupboard, (b) I can keep an accessible “pic ‘n’ mix” assortment in one large container, and (c) they’re much more convenient for putting in handbags for when away from home.

It’s good that the outer box is recyclable, and the tags are staple-free; however, I’m disappointed that these envelopes have inner foil and aren’t recyclable, and also the lack of information on the box re: the bag itself, tag and string, hence docking a star. I appreciate that it’s difficult to find affordable, non-plastic, sustainable and recyclable/compostable materials that do the job of keeping the teabags fresh, and I hope that Twinings will find suitable envelopes very soon – as some other manufacturers have already.

I should say from the outset that I have never tried Jerky before, so have nothing to compare this product with. I really didn’t like it though, the taste, smell, appearance or the texture. The taste was sweet, not particularly meaty. There was an odd smell to it, maybe a little fishy. It doesn’t have the most appetising appearance or texture, but I don’t think any jerky does.

Its definitely very addictive, and whilst it is an incredibly small amount of meat in the packet I was pleased that it had come to an end as it was becoming overwhelmingly sweet the more I ate!

Amazing smoked, sweet savoury taste that gets better and better the more you chew.

The meat is firm, chewy, but not tough or grizzly. The taste is quite strong with an emphasis on being sweet and salty at the same time. It does leave you wanting a long drink afterwards. As you chew the jerky, you can get all the lovely flavours of smoked wood, rosemary and other herbs. It's a real taste experience.

They are, as described, noticeably acidic. I like a robust black coffee, made in cafetière.  Normally if a coffee is described as having acid notes I dont really notice - stronger, weaker, bitter or just bad coffee, yes, but never really picked up on the acidic before but this did.

Clarification would be good as presumably its predominantly vegans/veggies buying vegetable based (vs fake meat) burgers. 

If youre not bothered re contamination, I thought these were ok with all the standard veggie burger stuff - roll, vegan cheese, condiments, salads etc. I dont mind softer bean burgers but I know some people find them too mushy. Its good that they provide 1 of the 5 a day portions. Would be easier to be able to oven cook as I burned them black under the grill.

https://www.ocado.com/products/charlie-bigham-s-risotto-for-2-with-chicken-mushroom-91115011,I was looking forward to this but found it very rich and the rice was like pudding rice instead of risotto rice. The combination of chicken and cheese was a bit off-putting. It lacked flavour too and I had to add a few grinds of black pepper and some garlic salt. Altogether it was not to my taste.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/charlie-bigham-s-risotto-for-2-with-chicken-mushroom-91115011,The rice was claggy and had no parmesan tang at all - tasted rather sweet more than anything. There were only 4 measly pieces of chicken on top and the whole thing was kind of sad. Won't buy again.,NA

However, our latest order was almost ruined by Ocado. The risotto arrived upside down and had started to overflow the paper liner in Bigham's trendy wooden cooking tray. I had to rescue the risotto from its container immediately, and transfer it to a casserole dish. Fortunately we had planned to eat it that evening. ",NA

Having read one of the reviews, I checked on the NHS websites about the sweeteners contained in the yogurt, Acesulfame K, Sucralose.

The NHS has a page explaining this and talking about the evidence that they are safe. 

For me personally ever since starting to eat low carb (LCHF) I have missed fruit flavoured yogurt and wished for and bemoaned the lack of a no added sugar version.

The point of choosing a Greek-style yoghurt over any other yoghurt is its very thick consistency and the smooth, creamy mouth-feel.  Yes, Light & Free tastes nice, if rather artificial.  Yes, it's fairly thick.  But by lightening the texture of Light & Free, the yoghurt not only loses the consistency of a Greek-style yoghurt, it looks and tastes no different from any other non-Greek-style yoghurt labelled 'thick' out on the market.

But the consistency was fine, with a few pulpy bits, the container was sturdy and resealed well, and the dip itself is 44% aubergine, and 14% sesame paste. The rest is water, chickpeas, flavouring, parsley and preservatives. So I don't know what gave it that taste unless it was the sesame and flavourings.

Roastworks is a new artisan brand for me - and the info on the (nicely minimal) bag is quite sparse, so I googled them. I like the look of their ethical approach to farming and manufacture - and that they're a small, independent company.
I'll definitely try others in the range - I'm interested in their nespresso-style capsules for when there's just no time to do it properly! And for the evenings - Ocado, any chance you can stock their decaff ground coffee?

I was sent this tea to review and was surprised how much I enjoyed it. It has a very strong aroma to start with,  especially the fennel. However once the bag has been removed , the tea is so smooth and loses the fennel aroma slightly. I only infused it for five minutes instead of the recommended seven, although that is my preference to a weaker tea. My husband added a teaspoon of honey, whilst I drank it black. Absolutely wonderful, unfortunately it is quite expensive. Therefore I would probably only purchase occasionally.",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/balaggan-saffron-chai-459313011,I was asked by Ocado to review this product. The aroma of the bags is a strong fennel but that turns to a delicate honey-like flavour when brewed. I added milk to mine and found it to be quite refreshing. It has a slight natural sweetness to it so I didn't need to add sugar. It is a very smooth chai and overall I enjoyed it and I will use the rest of the bags. My only slight issue is the price. It is very expensive -more expensive even than Teapigs- and that puts it very firmly in the luxury treat market which is a shame as I'm sure lots more people would like the flavour and buy it weekly if the price-point were right.,NA

I took mine with some milk and find it a delicate blend with a heady nose. Brought back memories of visiting spice and tea plantations.

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-creme-fraiche-529296011,This is super creamy and tastes amazing on its own as well as great in cooking. Worth the extra calories!,NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-creme-fraiche-529296011,worth the wait for m&s to bring this out. a thick texture like clotted cream and nice and rich with that savoury/ lemony balance. I'm impressed with this. we used it in pasta and it was so rich that we didnt need to use the whole thing ,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-creme-fraiche-529296011,"I know everyone has been complaining about the lack of a full-fat version but they have really overdone it with this one. The texture is stiff, like spreadable butter or clotted cream. This might work for enriching sauces but it's absolutely useless for spooning or using as a topping. Everyone in the family found it too rich and cloying. I will be sticking with the half fat version or simply buy the soured cream instead.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-creme-fraiche-529296011,Relieved that M&S have the full fat version at last.  And I think this is probably the best.  Rich and creamy without the sharp tang of other CRs.  It has a thick smooth texture that doesn't liquify in a way others tend to do.,NA

I was delighted to find a full fat M&S option on Ocado and am glad to report that M&S has lived up to their reputation this time! This one is much, much thicker (think clotted cream) than the Waitrose one and tangier too. It’s also made with French milk in France, and the cream has a richer flavour and darker colour. But I still prefer the Waitrose creme fraiche because of the lighter texture and less tang. I think this really comes down to personal preference.",NA

I could mainly taste the *cucumber* and did wonder whether that is usual for gazpacho, which I'd previously been told was a 'cold *tomato* soup'. The ingredients list appears to be completely natural and there is high vegetable content, thus seemingly making this a healthy choice. There was plenty of gazpacho here and I was able to use it in two other meals as well: as a hot soup with other vegetables and herbs; and also as a sauce base for a spaghetti bolognese meal.

I just wish they'd bring out a low-sodium version!",NA

There is a raw flavour (I assume it's the onion) that overpowers everything else and by the end it's not very pleasant.

When we discovered Alvalle on trips to Madrid and later to France, all our futile efforts to make it ourselves were abandoned and focussed instead on getting this most perfect and authentic version over here in big enough batches to last out the summer. Thank goodness for Ocado's genius in stocking it. We buy it in bulk and drink it for breakfast, lunch and supper, serve it in shot glasses at parties, take frozen cartons camping to thaw deliciously into a chilled liquid lunch for the second day, and present it to friends at picnics to general gasps of wonder.

With other Pip Organic juices, he usually nearly finishes it all. With this one, he only drank just about half of it.

Till I discovered this organic oat milk. This milk I can live. It also makes a reasonably decent cup of coffee. As we know alternative milks cannot replicate EXACTLY cows milk. I find with this milk you do have to shake the carton well to distribute and mix well the oat milk. I wouldn't recommend putting this milk in a milk jug and leaving it in the fridge cause it separates and you have to stir it well before pouring over tea or cereal. If you forget it will be very watery. Easier to just shake well and pour from the carton each time you use it. But that is no big is it. New habit, Shake well and use. I will be buying this Organic Oat milk regularly. I found I have to use more of the milk to achieve a similar effect to milk, so it will work out more expensive. But this cannot be helped. I'm very fussy about my cup of tea and this milk added generously is pretty good. It does not change the taste of the tea or the coffee. You have to persevere with alternative milks, trying them all so I would suggest give this a go and see if Oat milk is for you. The fact that it is an Organic Oat milk is a BIG plus factor because anything organic is richer and or course preferable and better for you. As a long lasting milk which you can keep in your stock cupboard it is brilliant. It did not taste at all like Long Life milk. The Swede's have come up with a brilliant product. Thank you!",NA

I'd also like to point out that there seems to be some confusion about the way the oats are processed and whether it's healthy.  If you do actually go to the Oatly website you'll see that the process involves adding enzymes to the oat and water mixture to break down the oats a bit, and one of the resulting components is maltose, a natural sugar the comes from the oats.  They don't then just use this sugar and not the oats to produce the drink, as it seems some may believe; this is just a component of the oats that goes into the drink along with most of the rest of each oat.

In my opinion this product, due to its nice flavour and texture could get away with 0.8 of salt per 100g

Personally i've tried everything with tofu (many different brands of tofu too) from roasting, to baking/boiling/frying / microwaving /raw

But this is just so good in texture it tastes like a quality sausage, and I often eat it cold from the fridge.

Why can't all tofu have this texture? its like the flavour has been marinated in the cells of it, even with regular i could marinate in soy sauce and the sauce doesnt penetrate at all even after 30 minutes.. Supermarkets are really falling behind this basic element of tofu I think, surely they can create something like this?

I usually use whole beans, but since I was away on a self catering holiday, I thought I'll take this along my V60 cafetiere to give it a try.
To be honest, I had very low expectations and was worried it was some cheap robusta blend, but no, this is actually a very decent blend, probably above the average quality out there. I had some backup Lavazza Oro beans with me, but I actually didn't feel the need to rely on them (and my dreaded hand grinder). 
I will recommend this for breakfast, I found the slightly nutty smoky notes works better that way. It doesn't work so well as an after meal coffee in my idea, as it lacks the strength and character.
Would that buy it again? Probably not unless I needed emergency coffee, and this was the only brand I recognised on offer.

I'm also happy with plastic packaging. There's a cardboard pulp shortage due to demand and lobbying and complaining won't magic up any more. Plastic egg boxes are also recyclable. And, if you're from the generation that re-used everything anyway as a matter of course, they have many other uses.

BUT - this particular brand I'm reviewing is significantly cheaper, does not state the species of the hens produced the eggs, and the egg yolks all look UNIFORMLY orange - each single one of them! THEREFORE, I'm a bit concerned if these hens were fed some additives to diet that produced this bright orange colour of yolks? Also, must say they taste somehow strange - I'd rather stick with Legbar eggs even if they are sometimes pale yellow - they tastes just as good...

Made it up to my usual small (200ml) latte. This was ok. Drinkable and certainly better than some non-Nespresso pods Ive tried. But the flavour didnt really carry through as well as Nespresso pods do. 

So, these are ok, I could live with them if I couldnt get hold of actual Nespresso pods but Id go with Starbucks pods over these (since they are made by Nespresso and available in shops). Dont really understand how respected coffee companies arent able to make pods that match up with Nespressos!

""Pepper"" should appear in the title though as it's more dominant than the ale & the onion! Fortunately I love pepper so I'll overlook the description fail.

I didn't see or taste any silverskin onions in my meal, but they are shown on the box art as whole onions. Delicious meal with tender beef. Around 1.5 portions by my reckoning, not 2. I like it.
