I was unimpressed. The quantity is stingy. Based on the nutrition info it looks as though this is meant for 2 people. There is not nearly enough for 2 people.
We added noodles to bulk it out into a decent lunch. 
The soup itself is pleasantly flavoured but quite unpleasant to look at. It has the appearance of a cheap tinned soup, dull and murky looking veg.
Disappointed!",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/daylesford-organic-10-hour-chicken-bone-broth-with-lemongrass-red-chilli-502753011,This is beautiful! The chilli is like a mild white pepper taste. The lemongrass is ever so subtle it's like it's barely there. A lot of 'ruffage' in there to make it a substantial soup for lunch. I am looking forward to it popping up on a flash sale again but I will probably buy it as a treat as well. Thus review is from someone who eats vegetarian 90% of the time too!,NA

I make a lot of my own soups and asian-style broths but there is no way I could get this flavour without a serious kitchen team. The list of ingredients is exquisite and the taste really is beautiful.

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-celeriac-518566011,The first celeriac I bought was fresh enough but for the price paid it was unacceptably small - about the size of a grapefruit. Tried again this month and it was slightly bigger but still only 760g in weight. In all the main supermarkets including Waitrose the celeriac is priced per Kg and I wish Ocado would do the same or at least guarantee a minimum weight as Morrisons do online (900g). The latest purchase does not look very fresh either - wrapped in plastic but already overly brown on the cut faces on day of delivery.  Due to the small size I had to go out to purchase a 2nd celeriac locally and it's far better in size and quality than the M&S offering. Tried M&S celeriac on Ocado twice now and there will not be a third time!,NA

The label made a big deal of how many spices it had been marinated in, so I expected it to have a real depth of flavour, but for me it just tasted like dry herbs. So whilst the idea and texture were good, you should only buy if you really dig the dried herb flavour. I wouldnt buy again but glad I tried it. The yogurt accompaniment is nice and garlicky, but again, they sprinkled dried herbs in it so you get these pops of overpowering, still dehydrated herb in your teeth. I think a development chef made something really great here and then someone came along and said Hmm, it needs more, and then shook a load of dried mixed herbs all over it and didnt bother tasting it again.",NA

The zesty yoghurt dressing was lovely and that added flavour, but I could of done with more of that, and there was plenty of meat on there.

Im often quite limited with what Indian food I can eat, as I really do not like heat or chillis. 

Daal is one of the few dishes that I regularly have, and I was quite happy to receive a free sample from Ocado to review. 

This is quite possibly the worst I have ever had!

I love lentils and thought that this looked tempting to start with, as I could see large, whole lentils floating in the sauce. That was as far as being tempted went. 

There was no thickness at all my to the sauce, as though none of the lentils had broken down to thicken it it was really watery. 

and just to keep the watery theme running, this daal then followed suit with the taste. Flavourless and watery. 

I think if I had mixed some turmeric, water, cornflour and tinned lentils Id have probably made a fairly decent duplicate of this. 

I genuinely would not pay a single penny for this, and to be honest, wouldnt even eat it again if it was given to me.",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/samosaco-tarka-daal-565101011,This was more like Tarka Daal soup which btw is actually a thing now.  How much has the price of lentils skyrocketed that it needs to be watered down to this consistency.  Annoying because it then alters the rest of the meal.,NA

Whilst I'm an omnivore, I'm also lactose intolerant, so always interested in trying dairy-free food. I was very impressed at how tasty this is! The pastry, whilst not the best shortcrust I've tried, is better than many of the shop-bought quiche pastries around, and has seeds for extra texture. The filling is delicious: moist, fresh, and with a good whack of black pepper to give it a kick.
Whilst one could argue the semantics of calling something without eggs a quiche, I'm happy  to just enjoy eating this .I tried it cold this time, but will give it a go hot when I next buy one (and there will be a next time). The only concern is that it tastes healthier than I suspect it is!",NA

As usual with me, I put it in the crisper drawer and forgot about it for the first week - bear in mind it is only guaranteed for 3 days - so I had to cut off 2 rotted patches at the base of the outermost leaves. Had I thought about it, of course, I would have wrapped it in paper towel and put it back in the bag and perhaps avoided this. Happily, the rest of the leaves were fine and I made a further salad yesterday. I still have enough left for 2 more salads as I only use a few leaves per salad.

Paired it with avocado to mellow it out a bit but I imagine it would also be good in a salad with soft cheese or a creamy dip.

https://www.ocado.com/products/clipper-organic-white-tea-bags-43165011,"This organic white tea is fair-trade and organic, so I bought it. I love the taste, as it is closer to black tea than to white tea and I would love to drink it regularly. It has a strong, warm and a bit sweet and lightly smokey flavour like English breakfast, but much richer.  If I was not looking for a tea low on oxalate, I would have kept drinking it daily (green and white tea are much lower on oxalate than black one). But as it tastes not as delicate as white tea tends to taste, but closer to a black tea, I fear there will be more oxalate in it. I am not giving 5 stars, because I assume people who want white tea buy it for the white tea taste and this would be a misleading rating. Regarding the price and it nevertheless being organic and fair-trade, one can't expect a white tea made from the finest and youngest leaves, I guess, so the stronger taste and it being in between white and black tea was most likely to be expected and for this I am thinking it is a very good tea.",NA

So, Melrose and Morgan Lemon Drizzle Loaf Cake...

The pros ~  the cake arrived in good condition, and looked quite wholesome and homemade.  The ingredients list reflected a simple recipe made using the same foods as I use to make my own. My friends liked it, thinking that it was a Madeira cake, and polished it off.  

The cons ~ the lemon flavour was barely perceptible, and there was no characteristic crunch of sugar on top.  Neither was there the typical moist texture of a lemon drizzle cake, in fact it was rather dry.  The price was that of a luxury cake, however, it was, in fact, rather basic and disappointing.

Highly recommended!  and brilliant for bacon sandwiches or chopped and added to items you would normally add bacon to.


One suggestion, is to get your non-stick or griddle pan VERY hot, brush with a groundnut oil and fry for only a minute a side as it carries on cooking.  Make sure to use a pan where you don't crowd the bacon, as it boils instead of fries.  Hope this helps!",NA

It also allows you to squeeze the 'bottle' in to a space that may not otherwise be big enough for a normal bottle and then when it's empty, you can pierce the handle, deflate it and throw it away, albeit in the normal waste.

I’ve never bought this brand before, but do buy other fresh tortellini. This was certainly a cut above the rest! Beautiful pasta, rich meaty filling with a natural herby flavour. The ingredients set it apart as good quality and it’s so fresh that they label the day of making it (which was only 2 days before I received it). It had an expiry date of 4 days from delivery and we left it until the last day before eating- it was still fresh and in perfect condition. 

None of the torteloni were broken - the lovely eco friendly cardboard box it arrives in protects it from all squashing and mishaps.

I thought it wouldn’t be enough for two with my husband’s hearty appetite! But it’s very satisfying and with some green salad and/or some bread it’s plenty filling enough for us. The truffle butter was the right amount for us, but we added a little more Parmesan. Oh and we cooked it 30 seconds longer than said, just to make sure the thicker bits of pasta were cooked.
  
Yes it’s pricier than other fresh tortellini we buy, but this did feel way more special. We would definitely buy it again for a treat.",NA

So if you have hormonal issues, especially if female, please read a bit more into stevia.

We’re all trying to eat less salt these days and as I don’t eat much myself, this is way too salty for me, which is a shame because I would buy it regularly otherwise. 
The flavours are really intense, you can detect walnuts as a texture and as a flavour, which is a definite bonus. Rich roasted red peppers tomato paste and spices, with pomegranate molasses make this a nicely indulgent dish.

Ive never had red rice before and not a rice fan but this added a nuttier flavour and I loved it. 
I hadnt realised these pots can be frozen so the sell by date being long in the fridge they went. Not for long!  A instantly easy meal was needed so out it came. Unlike many one person meals this was plenty enough for a solo diner. Chunky & satisfying & not swimming in watery sauce 
Would look good on a plate but I ate straight from the pot as i couldnt wait!

First of all, I was pleased to find that the taste seemed exactly the same as standard PG Tips so for people who want or need the added health benefits with the familiar taste will love this.  For me, the added cost outweighs the benefits as I feel I could get the same benefits from a good quality multi vitamin and there is no way to tell whether it is having any impact on my health.

These tea pyramids are basically PG tips tea with added vitamin C. I am not in a position to compare the two types of PG tips tea because I do not drink this particular brand. I enjoy several mugs of black tea every day, but my tea is made from loose tea leaves and needs to stew for 5 minutes. There is no question that the PG tips tea is more convenient, because it is nice, dark and strong and ready to drink after less than half a minute. But I really cannot see the point of taking vitamin C with a cup of tea, when oranges or vitamin pills are available anywhere, and there are other products with added vitamin C.",NA

The range includes 'Immunity' - this one; 'Metabolism'; and 'Caffeine' plus. First off, they're very expensive, considering I can buy a box of over 250 PG Tips for just over £3. So these are aimed at a small niche, a very driven health conscious/high performance individual that needs to perhaps stay alert for longer, whilst maintaining peak mind, body and spirit performance, who also happen to love builders' tea ...above anything else. ...Like I said, a niche market. The box is small - a good size for the workplace. Apart from that not much more can be said, except that the flavour is no different to that of normal builders' tea.

Very pleasant typical PG Tips tea flavour, with no discernible impact on taste from the added Vitamin C. This is what they claim, and would certainly seem to be the case.
To their credit, PG Tips tea bags are fully bio-degradable and do not contain plastic, unlike most of their competitors, and this is a significant fact which is now highlighted on the pack, and should certainly influence customers. Also the tea itself is certified as sustainably sourced, which looks like another plus.

But I really can't see who this is aimed at or who would want to pay 5x the price (vs Ocado prices for normal PGTips) for this product. Each cup/mug of tea contains as much VitC as approx a sixth to a third of an orange. So not would be regarded as a theraputic dose. Health junkies won't be keen as it doesn't tell us what form of VitC is used (the chemical composition can vary with varying benefits/downsides).

It will be something I would definitely buy on a regular basis. I eat vegetarian and often eat tofu, but normally it’s the plain one. Then I add my own flavourings, generally Asian or some kind of curry, and sometimes liquidised to make a dip with flavourings. This smoked tofu from The Tofoo company is lovely - it’s a mild natural tasting smoked flavour, which is like you’ve smoked it yourself over a wood fire. I’ve sometimes had smoked flavour food that was so artificial tasting, I didn’t like it. So for this smoked tofu, I tried a small piece on its own and the texture and flavour is good enough for me to enjoy just like that in a sandwich maybe, or with salad. Then I fried some in slices, and that was great too. I would recommend this to anyone who likes healthy food and wants to cut down on meat, particularly cured meats and pork products. It’s very versatile and would be nice with olives, hummus and crackers or any Italian Mezze foods. I was very impressed because I love natural gentle flavours, but it may be too gentle for some.",NA

https://www.ocado.com/products/yorkshire-gold-teabags-13167011,"I only drink tea, never coffee and I am one of those discerning/fussy (depending on your viewpoint) tea drinkers who have to have it just so.  Although all tea comes from the same plant, it is all in the prep. Filtered water heated to the correct temperature depending on the leaf (white 70, green 80-85, Oolong, Pu ehr 90) and black tea should always be 100 straight onto the bag, left to sit undisturbed for at least 5 minutes and then whole or semi-skimmed milk. Get the temperature wrong and the tea is either dull and flavourless or scalded and bitter. IMO there are only four good mainstream teas (affordable and not silly money per bag) and Yorkshire Tea is one one of them. I travel a lot and take my tea with me. As a result there are many Yorkshire Tea converts in the most unlikely and inaccessible places! I have even been known to take my tea to a local cafe and ask them if they would use my Yorkshire Gold teabags and ended up with everyone wanting some and loving it!",NA

Don't worry about getting through them all.  Just give them a quick wash and pat dry then put in the freezer.

Nice in savoury dishes too, but honestly it's cheaper to buy tinned coconut milk (anywhere but Ocado). To answer the annoying question reciew: F.Y.I. this is basically the same taste and recipe to CoYo and both Cocos and CoYo were always dairy free. CoYo was blamed by a chain restraurant when a customer at the chain had an allergy reaction to a meal at the restaurant. CoYo was owned by the same people as Nush.

It has the artificial flavour of 'bacon' flavoured crisps and the moth-feel of one those shoe freshener inserts.

Then I started to fry them and the smell was awful, like I was frying something inedible. Still, I thought they might taste good anyway. No, awful, the worst vegan food I have ever eaten, the second bite was the end for me, I can't even describe the awful taste.

There was a decent amount of cod and salmon but they’re both very bland - haddock and hake are far more tasty in y opinion. I couldn’t taste any smoked haddock, though it’s listed in the ingredients and the mashed potato was a good consistency. I’m always surprised when people say Charlie’s B’s dishes are expensive.. do they know how much real food costs and paying staff etc?

The predominant flavour and even the smell is of apple, not surprisingly as that is what it mostly consists of. 
It also has a rather thin texture for a smoothie. 
However, it does have a pleasant flavour & a fairly low sugar content for this kind of drink. Probably because they have not added any sugar, which is great. 
There was a hint of strawberry & lime, but it was just a bit watery & wishy washy in flavour for the very high price tag.",NA

The kids adored it (their words) adding: “best smoothie ever”, but “maybe a bit too much lime”. I guess the lime gives it the “Zing”. 
We grandparents liked the taste very much, and thought we could clearly identify all the different fruits, so we were surprised to read that so much of it is apple juice. 
It’s high in (naturally occurring) sugars: the 65 grams in the bottle is over 70% of the daily recommended maximum and a whole bottle might all go down rather too easily. 
Maybe it tastes a bit too good to keep regularly in the house - it could be too tempting.

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-select-farms-british-2-duck-breast-portions-516324011,Ambiguous description. Is it a portion of a breast (yes)  or an individual portion of a duck (whole breast is normal)?

https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-select-farms-british-2-duck-breast-portions-516324011,There are 2 perfect portions (not 2 full breasts). Make a super easy dinner. The meat is always tasty and fresh.,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-select-farms-british-2-duck-breast-portions-516324011,"apparently 2 ""duck breast portions"" is a duck breast cut lengthwise down the middle.... this is not only slightly misleading given the image looks like 2 breasts, but it's poorly done and makes for a terrible cooking experience.

To cook duck breast properly you need to start it in a cold pan skin side down and gradually bring it up to medium-high heat in order to render the fat in the skin and crisp it up before finishing in the oven to cook to medium. This is not possible to do with these  ""portions"" because they are not balanced in the same way as a whole breast.... they do not stand properly on their skin side because of the way they've been cut meaning they fall over. so you have to tend to them constantly to make sure they stay upright and don't fall over which will overcook the meat. that prevents you from cooking anything else at the same time.  

I would rather they provide one whole duck breast and state it feeds 2 people. At £5 per breast it's extortionately expensive compared to the Gressingham brand  when you get 2 whole breasts for £9 RRP, but normally about £7 as it's frequently on offer. That's a whole 10-40% more expensive per breast for something that's been quite literally butchered to a point beyond use.

https://www.ocado.com/products/oteas-passionfruit-orange-481397011,I was given these teabags to review.  I think they are a luxury rather than for everyday drinking as they are expensive at 22 pence a teabag.  However they are eco friendly teabags.  The fruity smell of the teabags is evident when you open the box and both the aroma and taste are predominantly of passion fruit.  You have a quite a wait for your cup of tea as it is suggested to brew between 5- 10 minutes or longer.  I dont think I would purchase them again as I am not a fan of the taste but maybe one of their other fruity flavours would suit me better,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/oteas-passionfruit-orange-481397011,Really nice fruity tea bags. A little expensive for the for me. ,NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/oteas-passionfruit-orange-481397011,Received these to review and as someone who doesnt drink fruit teas did so with an open mind. The aroma was very strong when opening the packet but it was a nice smell. It tasted of the passion fruit and was a pleasant change.

https://www.ocado.com/products/oteas-passionfruit-orange-481397011,"This smells very strongly of passion fruit, and the nice little bags are biodegradable which earns it points. However taste wise, it's a fairly generic fruit tea taste, with none of the strong passion fruit flavour that it smells of. the taste is more orangey and fairly mild although it develops more the longer you leave it. Nothing to write home about for me. ",NA
https://www.ocado.com/products/oteas-passionfruit-orange-481397011,"I was given these in exchange for an honest review.  They smell wonderful and have plenty of flavour.  I really like that the bags are biodegradable. The are good enough that I will finish the pack but will probably not buy any due to the underlying taste common to most tissanes.  I always think of it as a dry leaf taste that, to my mind, detracts  from the otherwise very pleasant flavour.",NA

The packet comes with 15 pyramid shaped transparent bags, and you can easily see all the ingredients there in pieces, instead of them being almost pulverised. This herbal tea to me tastes of the mixture of all the included ingredients which are several, it does not distinctively taste of orange and passion fruit only.

The smell of the tea is amazing when you open the pack and its whole leaf tea, but I think theres just not enough tea in each bag and so the flavour just isnt strong enough - even when only adding a small amount if water and leaving for longer to brew, it tastes too much of boiling water and couldnt really taste the passionfruit.",NA

This has a surprisingly pleasant and natural orange and passion fruit flavour, without being overwhelming.    I leave the teabag in and it doesn't spoil or taste stewed.  I would buy it as my experience of orange flavoured teas is that they are disappointing so this exceeded my expectation. A cautionary note on it being gluten-free.  I don't know of any tea containing gluten so this labeling may be seen as nonsense.",NA

I thought I'd give these a go:  passionfruit is a naturally sweet fruit.  I think it's one of the best fruit teas I've tried.  I think it would probably be better as an iced tea:  as it cooled down, I found the flavour came out more than when it was steaming hot.  But, at the end of the day, I'm really a coffee girl, through and through.  I'm glad I tried this, but I'm not converted!",NA

Rapeseed is a light oil loaded with good fats but far less than olive oil. And rapeseed is one of the largest crops in England. I know this bread is from Poland but my point here is about rapeseed oil. Something has to be used in place of butter and rapeseed is high in omega 3&6.
Why is it a shame to support farmers who grow rapeseed rather than greek or spanish olive oil? Sunflower oil does not work well in baking because it is too runny and has a very high smoke point which means the heat from the oven makes the oil get absorbed into the bread or cake changing the flavour and causing a greasy texture. Trust a baker to know what they are doing especially if the baked item is good. BTW. In general it isnt very usual in Polish culture to toast a hearty grain bread. Have it with a good cheese and an apple or with soup or stew.",NA
